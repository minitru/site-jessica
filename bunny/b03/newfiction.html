He continued, through Jason, to pay regular salaries to a whole bunch 
of dead people, which most of those who knew him thought was touching, 
but which, Etienne was certain, indicated Bo's leavetaking of his senses 
some time back ... just how far back he couldn't say, since after 
abolishing death Bo had abolished the passage of
time and exiled himself to infinity ...

A biological trick put on this earth to
       slowly squeeze a mother to death with the hydraulic stupidity that
moves
       her muscles. Oh Jesus, a field-day for hormones, starting in to rip
open her
       gangly legs so that she couldn't even balance over the water that
keeps her
       alive. An insult to the idea that women could ever make it on their
own. A
       curse, love's tumour, the price of a long-forgotten orgasm, a birth
more
       useless than any iffy Heidi . . .

Of course I still did not write. How could I? But
       perhaps there is no need for writers to lead exquisite depraved
scintillating
       lives after all. Perhaps no one ultimately cares how many lovers
you've had
       or how much you drink or whether you are dying of a beautiful
disease. Or
       maybe it's simply I who never really cared about these things. You
said that
       nothing really matters until after it is dead.
