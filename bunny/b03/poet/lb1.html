<H3> A Greeting</H3>
<PRE>
<H4>
	When I see some people, I want to kiss them.  Rarely can I resist
the urge to press my lips to their skin.  Others prefer a firm handshake, a
friendly hug, a discreet wave from a distance.  I like to kiss.
	A man sits in front of me at the cinema waiting for the show to
begin.  He has a large birthmark on his cheek and is unsure of where to
rest his hands.  He spills popcorn down his shirt, sighs cheerlessly.
	See how I lean over the seat and grab him.  
	See his surprise when I press his hands to the armrests, push my
lips to his neck.
	I move in for another and try to reach his mouth, there.   
	I bite his lips.  
	I draw his tongue between my teeth, nibble on his lips some more.
	I pick him off his seat, hold him to my chest and whisper how good
it is, I kiss his hair, chin, his tired eyes, I kiss his birthmark and
acquaint his ears with my tongue, I suck at his face, siphon its tension
into mine, I drain the breath from his stomach and taste the passing
staleness of his worry, I place his limp body back on the seat, say: <I>So
nice to meet you, so nice to meet.</I>
