           MY CAT WAGAMAMA

What most excites her
is crawling into a cardboard box.

No way to stop 
her cruelty to lizards.

For sleep she curves in my out-basket.
Sprawls on her back in hot weather.

                *
                                    
Her name, Wagamama, Englished-Japanese,
means "thinks of self, not group." 

Could call it "centeredness" I guess,
but better "generic cat."

                *

Across the chasm of our difference --
her grace and my slow eyes --

like any pair of lovers 
we gaze, and gaze.

She'll knead me with her claws. 
I'll croon to her in cat.

She'll sit unmewing beside her dish
and I will feed her.
