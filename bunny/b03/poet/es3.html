Origin of the Species


Morning voices hold us briefly,
Letting us go on our way
When the sunlight touches the first fish,
Her tail glimmering like something
Terribly rare---perhaps never seen
On the planet, now suddenly everywhere,
Accepting itself as different,
Though very much a part of us,
Older somehow by being new.
The moment it was forged into being
We cringed, thinking how could this be,
Accepting its bizarre feeding habits,
Its four legs allowing it to crawl
Upon the surface. And now we read
In Nashville, Tennessee, one was caught,
Trained to sing for a roadside inn,
Cracking jokes with the tourists,
All joyous, biting down on pears
And apples and peaches. We wish we could
Listen to that singing fish.
Ain't it something the way Gershwin
Comes out all sweet as you please.
Wish I could sound that good.
Nothing ever comes out
Like you think it will.
Even the birds know that,
And the fish jump at the lake
For almost nothing. Their splashes
Take off where we leave off.
Those are last words out there,
Rippling to ever-widening circles,
Touching the rocks on the bank
And telling them to wait their turn.
