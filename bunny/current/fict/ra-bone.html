A brief note on the novel:</CENTER><P>

Napoleon's Retreat  is not a historical novel, per se, nor the literal
account of Napoleon's falling back across the snowy plains of Russia.
Rather, it is metaphorical in every sense -- maybe mostly in the sense that
knowledge of nothing  can come to us without being bent out of all
recognition by the very act of knowing.
<P> The novel begins as a political thriller, on a day that has become
iconic in American mythology, November 22, l963. What sets off the events
of the book, however, is not the killing of John Kennedy, but the effect of
that killing on an ill-conceived attempt on the life of Richard Nixon. The
jilted assassin is Albert Hess: mercenary, novelist, charmer of young
socialites, and mentor of the 'Canadian boy' -- in the words of Hess --
Robert (Bo) Weary, a man born to a wealthy Montreal Westmount family, who
has joined Hess, Hess's young wife Monica, and Monica's brother Sampson, in
a plot to do the job left unfinished by Albert Hess in 1963. The
conspirators plan to kill Nixon in Nederland, Colorado. The year is 1974.
What happens unravels the plot, but sets Robert Weary on a life-long
trajectory of obsessive self-reflection: Hess falls from the sky and breaks
his neck in Colorado. As he lies face-up in an ice-cold creek visions come
to his head, visions which the young Robert Weary takes as his own. Out of
guilt, inwardness, self-expiation, Weary begins to rewrite his life and
that of all his friends, to edit the world and to pull it into oblivion
with him. His guilty affair with Hess's wife Monica, the suicide of his
brother Ralph, a joyless relationship with his wife Jaqui, and the
dionysian nights spent drinking with failed poets Ellis Rancourt, Marie
Leveau and Angus McCuddy, all become cautionary tales told with an aim to
doing, through narrative, what the meaningless episodes of life never can
-- form some sort of mythic and complete story, as we dream in childhood
our lives must do.
<P>
 The narrator, or orchestrator of these tales, is the Napoleon of
the title -- he styles himself Robert Napoleon Weary, and sometimes Robert
Napoleon Lajoie, a minor league baseball player in the 1950s. As Robert
Weary he is one of the wealthiest men in Canada, but all he can do with the
money and power at his disposal is to dig himself deeper into anonymity. He
imagines he inhabits a twilight world of writers and artists, in a place
called Viola's Dance Bar. He cynically works as an ad copywriter for a
company he owns. He retains cryptic control over both Monica and Jaqui. He
supports Jaqui's brother Etienne, who is building a monster in the shed, a
monster called Wittgenstein. He hires actors to impersonate him. He
constructs shadowy morality plays involving an incarnation of Satan -- The
Peacock Angel. He writes himself in and out of the stories of his life, as
the whim directs him. He listens to the voice of Hess from the frozen
stream -- The Talking Head. He relives the heady revolutionary summer spent
in Philadelphia and Mexico with Hess and Monica.
<P>
Wittgenstein comes alive. She is a woman. Weary takes off with her in
Airstream camper, bound for The City, for Viola's Dance Bar, for New
Mexico, no one knows for sure. Wittgenstein is like the first human in
Eden. She is programmed to know everything. Voices fill her head, whole
novels full of them, including Napoleon's Retreat. All the other
characters, assembled from time and space at Robert Weary's solstice party
in Toronto, are left behind. Vern and the Minnows play "All my exes live in
Texas." Everybody gets drunk. Night swallows them all. Witt and Bo are
gone. All that is left are the voices.
<P>
But all that is just plot. The novel is its language and its metaphorical
mysteries. Bo Weary's life, like the lives of all the others in the book,
vanishes at the end. Insofar as it makes sense, it makes sense through
parables, myths, made-up accounts. In one such, Man on a Blue Moon, Weary
writes the life of a doomed astronaut stranded on a moon of Neptune,
singing country and western songs into a dead mike, imagining Monica in
far-off Montreal, in the light of the Mount Royal cross. It is self-pity of
a particularly narcissistic sort, and about as far off as Robert Napoleon
Weary thinks he can go. But of course he comes back to the lonely voice
inside of him, which will entertain him through the dark.
<P>
In this sense, the subject of the story is story-telling, and the whole of
the world is language. Early in the book, Monica tells Bo of a fabled
talking head fished from the Aegean, which no one listens to because a
bigger American talking head, complete with commercials, beams its talk
across the islands. The broken voice of Hess tells his own stories from a
swift, cold Colorado creek. Monica, Jaqui, Etienne and Witt tell their
stories too, when they can find a gullible islander to listen. And McCuddy
spins his celtic magic in Viola's Dance Bar, where the house band is Vern &
the Minnows, with Monica on sax, and where the night, like the night on
Neptune's moon, never comes to an end.

... he had not wanted to get into a conversation with the head of Hess but found himself in one nevertheless.
Oh, he was doing most of the talking, which was the reverse of the usual, but Hess's
head  had a kind of alert and sympathetic aspect also unusual, which made Bo feel as though
it wished him to  talk, just go on talking, pouring out doubts and deliberations as if his own
part in the plot warranted  such solicitude. Of course it was out of the ordinary too that he
gazed on the head of Hess through six  inches of clear running water, which provided the
wavy illusion of life, further adding to the image of  discriminating listener that Hess's head
had assumed, while shucking the body like so much inattentive  viscera. The body was there
alright, also beneath the cold, clear water, save for one Wolverine boot, the  left, gaining
leverage and a certain torque, it appeared, from the snow spackled bank of the
little  mountain creek in which Hess rested, on his back as he'd so often nightmared, crashing
down from the  sky, beholding the blue plasma of eternity, more hellish to Hess than the dark
pits of hell. 
<P>
While he talked Bo had been thinking of Monica; who
wouldn't, even in a grave confrontation  with Hess? He was thinking of six months before,
midsummer's night in Philadelphia, thinking of  Monica's long dark hair as a slightly drunk
Hess combed it out with a silver and topaz brush, all the  while pouring out a glissade of
words, half apology and half manifesto, while Monica remained silent as
Hess was silent now, isolated in her thoughts. The scary truth beginning to dawn was that no
one listened, that each passage of life was summed, more often than not, by a rambling
discourse that flowed  one way and brought nothing back, no reply, no message of hope, no
solace. So private was  consciousness that, once you stripped away the illusions of
community and connectedness, what  remained was like a single candle flame, soon guttered,
throwing just enough heat and light to suggest  how on and on the darkness went, and how,
like the big, dark bruise of the universe itself, it had no  other side ...

The Weary Chronicles<BR>
September 20, 1983
</I></CENTER>
<P>
The funeral's just the way Ralph Weary would have wanted it, stylish in that High
Anglican way, but severe: no loud lamentation, weeping or gnashing of teeth.
Ralph's brother Bo is feeling  a real though selfish grief, and a bitter one, because the
timeworn format permits no feeling at  all. It's nothing but slick and formal gesture, the cream
of Montreal's anglo fastness gathering to  mark the last exit of one of their own.
<P>
Dust swirls in sunny cathedral spaces, symbolic of what has been stirred up
from  history to hang over this one small mortality, an invisible mnemonic of death let out of
its  jewelled coffin, maybe for the last time. 
<P>
The Bishop's voice cuts
across the overripe display of memorial jungle plants like a May  frost, wilting them stem and
leaf, Bo thinks, though the floral displays leaned up against the alter and
coffin are largely plastic ...  <I>and why this sturdy pillar of the Wearys should so suddenly
be taken from us is a mystery known only to Him who by God's grace walks
among you now, the word  made flesh ... Ralph Everly Weary, we commit your spirit to Him
as we commit your mortal remains to the earth ... 
</I>
<P>
To Bo, the sermon resembles one of Ralph's nightmares, a struggling into
gluey speech, a  mouth that opens and closes, compelling bubbles of fear into the air. Ralph
had nightmares
almost every night when he was a kid. When it was bad Mrs. Gianfridda would sit in the
dark on the cane chair between their beds, hands lightly resting on the cat curled on her
lap. She  brought the smells of the kitchen with her -- flour, cloves and cinnamon. 
<P>
Their shared bedroom was on the third floor, above the back stairs, tucked under
the  eaves. It was large and airy. A colony of bats also called it home, at least in summer. In
winter  they flew to Mexico, but always came back. 
<P>
When they were
boys Ralph and Bo often sat on the oak window seat and ate breakfast,  pushing the six foot
high leaded windows as far out as they could, looking from the heights on  to a good part of
Montreal: a flank of the mountain, with its children and dogs playing, and old  men in cloth
caps leaning on walking sticks; the smaller, flatter and more crowded streets of  Notre Dame
de Grace; even a short section of the St. Lawrence, sparkling in the sun, where  rusty
freighters sailed at the head of fantail wakes until they passed out of sight behind the  distant,
dark cliffs of warehouses and grain elevators. [This is a lovely and haunting picture,  though I
can't say with certainty that I've seen it. I imagined I must have.] 
<P>
The
Bishop, during Bo's reverie, is earnestly occupied in spinning the late
summer  wavelengths of light into homiletic cloth of sterner, winter stuff, in case the indian
summer  ambiance lets anyone get too dreamy or philosophical. Bo decides to try and
separate the  congregation into summer grasshoppers and winter ants, with predictable and
disappointing  results. They are nearly all ants. 
<P>
The eulogy is a deep
summer hum, somnolent even as it pricks at sloth and vanity. It  builds like a thunderstorm in
the air around the bishop's shapely Olympian head. Bo looks  bleakly at the faces around him:
simple, fearful, dutiful, vacant ... the well tailored dark blue  and black suits and
dun coloured dresses, with here and there the shock of an iridescent blue  necktie or the
hummingbird flash of a dowager's hat. He knows Hugo Sr. will take account of 
such display in the solemn midst of Ralph's <I> danse macabre</I>: he is coldly
scrupulous in such matters -- which reflection brings Bo back to his
immediate problem: now the oldest surviving  son, he is heir to the Weary fortunes, Weary
lands and fiefs, Weary burden. The service implies 
all of this, not only the punctilious future of the dead brother on his voyage to the
afterworld, but Bo's own rite of passage into the forefront of family affairs, something he's
believed himself  well out of for years. With Ralph running The Weary Corporation
singlehandedly, and  singlemindedly, the possibility of Bo's becoming entangled had seemed
remote. It was possible  to pretend he didn't have the largest bankroll of anyone he'd ever
come across, including the  Philadelphia friends and associates of the Vaux family and almost
everyone in this church. <P>
The spectre of Monica stirs restlessly in the high
spaces, evoked by the thought of her  name, but not at all at home. The light streaming above
calls to Lucy more than anything, an  aspect of Monica that'd always come between them, a
thin, indivisible presence slipped even between <I>their kisses, poor
<P>
Ralph </I>... he's muddled through because sitting on
money and power hatches more money and power. To be truthful, Ralph
made a mess of things most of the time. And now
this. 
<P>
The Bishop was still on the stump, and through shimmery clouds of portraiture came
the  unmistakeable vision of the postmortem Ralph: virile captain of industry, guiding the
Weary  Corp. through the reefs of commerce. The Titan of St. James Street. This was all far
from the  truth, of course, but it was what everyone wanted to believe, not just for capitalist
and socialite  esprit but out of a deep compassion for the klutzy and lachrymose loser, Ralph,
whose report  cards had similarly been glossed over since first grade and whose life had at
least provided  countless occasions for Christian compassion. And not a few blameless
flunkeys were fired to  maintain the front. The reality was stark, accounting now for much of
the weight of Bo's sinking  heart: it was Bo, fast talking behind the scenes, who'd prevented
the head office from retreating  to Toronto during the recent Anglo exodus; it was Ralph,
talking prep school French to the chief political correspondent of 
<I>Le Devoir</I>,
who'd hogged all the credit ... no, the hell with poor Ralph, 
what about poor Bo, the only Weary in five generations to have pulled
himself clear of the family web, only to end up swimming helplessly in invisible
threads again, because Ralph, the
older of the two brothers, had taken an overdose of liver pills and died.
<I>Poor bloody Bo ... 
<P>

The Talking Head Talks
</CENTER>
<P>
 ... the man they called Hess puzzled Lopes, </I>[being oracular, The
Talking Head refers to itself in the 
third person.] <I> who gave him the dirtiest jobs around the camp and the
toughest out on patrol. There didn't seem to be a thing Hess wouldn't or
couldn't do, and Lopes, from the bottom of his heart, was  suspicious of the cheerful
Englishman who spoke a dozen different dialects and languages, cooked meals,  cleaned out
the latrines, and put himself on point when they patrolled deep into the jungle along
the  tributaries of the big river. No one else ever volunteered for that, the guerillas would
throw themselves  on anyone and hack them to pieces, or else saturate the area with mortar
fire until there wasn't a leaf  left. Hess didn't like him calling the black boys 'guineas' and he
had a few more odd ideas. He'd hit  Lopes in the mouth once, but Lopes figured it was just a
trick to get him to stick his neck out so he pretended it never happened. 
He would take care of Hess later, when the job was done and no one else was around. What the British were doing with a liason in Angola Lopes couldn't
figure anyhow, and  Hess drew his pay from some office across the border where they spoke
a language Lopes didn't  understand. He didn't trust Hess at all. Still, he treated Hess as an
equal, the only one in the squad,  maybe so he wouldn't have to face the fact Hess made him
look helpless, and he was the captain while  Hess seemed to have no rank at all. The crazy
voices threw him. Hess could talk anything. It was like a dozen different men
were wound around a spool in the man's crazy head. Who might speak next, and
in whose lingo? So Lopes kept his distance, the dignity of silence, and jealous
watch over the weapons.  Hess liked to carry nothing but a foot long cane cutting knife,
taking his Enfield only when out on  patrol. And he whistled tunes, American show tunes,
Lopes thought, and looked on Lopes with a  twinkle in his eye. Still, once he'd hit him, and
Lopes hadn't hit back. Couldn't afford more of that.  After the incident he'd saved his swagger
and his expletives for Lucrezia's in town where, unstrapping 
his guns and stepping out of his insignia, he put on the air of a landowner for the ignorant
girls ... and how was he to know he'd meet his own end in the arms of one such, when
some jealous patriot knocked  Lucrezia's out with a brand new Russian mortar, just to see
how the beautiful thing worked. The girl  lived, having used Lopes as a flak jacket ... Hess
laughed when he told the story, which he'd honed over  the years, even taking Lopes' point of
view, then reversing narrative field for the hilarious climax, which  smacked in the telling of
James Bond meets The Three Stooges. Monica, for one, was impressed. In his  own heart
Hess didn't know why he'd hit Lopes, since he himself had called the locals every racial slur under the sun, it was part of how he'd learned to signify himself in the
army. He no more knew his 
motive than Lopes knew his, and he still slept well at night. Killing Nixon had come
to him in a  prophetic dream and the anger and rationale had grown later, adhering to the act
like slugs to the  rainwet paths back home in Devon. No matter, it was always right to kill
those fat leeches of power,  even when they claimed to be on your side. Killing Nixon
wouldn't for a minute stop him falling,  which he went on doing till the end, asleep in
Monica's arms the last night, when over some jungle  ravine a bridge he'd been rigging
snapped and sailed a hundred feet down, so he woke up looking into Monica's
frightened eyes, holding her for slim comfort, hearing himself sob....
</I>[Monica told me she looked scared because she'd been dreaming of me.]
<I>
He slept
little after that, his next to last night, but still dreamt he was going hand
over hand across the gulley clutching nothing but blue air. The next
 night there was no sleep at all, and in the morning, previewed in true Hollywood fashion
by the dream in Monica's arms, he fell five thousand feet out of a plane
and was conscious all the way and a good deal  longer, lying in a cold liquid mirror vainly
trying to see what was on the other side. Point man again,  gazing without fear into crystal
nothing, and he imagines he sees Weary kneeling and talking to his  reflection on the other
side. He tries to call out but Monica shakes him awake again, this time to tell him  to roll
over, he's snoring. 
<P>
Finnegan happened to be lurching by the open door, just at that moment, on his way
to the  john. Finnegan's bladder was on fire again, probably his liver was shot. He would
never see a doctor. He  heard a scream from Monica's room but did not bother to think
anything of it. Monica often entertained  men who screamed, even after she married Hess.
She was grown up, what the hell. He held his red  
languid cock in his skinny hands and pissed a bright rainbow of fluids from his crock of a
bladder. It did not occur to him once that he was dying, because he thought of nothing else
all the time and was  inoculated against it. There were no theoretical limits to the body,
Finnegan Vaux knew. No matter  how long it lasted it could always last an hour more.... He
zipped his miscellany of thought shut and  went back to his room to play with his guns. Tex
Vaux rides again. He'd been infected with the excitement and would gladly shoot
Nixon too, if he didn't have to go too far out of his way. </I>
[When Marie looked at this passage she said that if Nixon ever showed 
up in The City he'd better duck.] <I> Poor bloody
<P>
Bo
... oh, it's alright </I>for you, brother Ralph, you've gone to glory. The glories back on earth,
if bumbling meekness is the key to heaven, are nothing compared to the
hosannas to come. You  even bumbled into your own death you must have heard, Ralph,
up there skulking in pearly  light, how you'd never intended to kill yourself. Liver pills? You
must have downed a thousand  of them, no single one any more than a benign pick me up,
but fatal in large quantities, like the  luckless singularities leading zigzag and surely: river
rocks to the far bank. You made such a fucking muddle of everything,
<I> Ralphy, but it stays inside me, like the pills you took, and won't be 
 coaxed out / </I>all Robert can do is squeeze from tightly closed eyes the few tears he will
manage out of this whole nightmare, his wandering attentions focused on
the eulogy again, as the  Bishop, maybe sensing the torpor falling over the congregation,
accelerates the pace of the  parable, tirelessly grinding out emblems of love, death and
salvation. 
<P>Outside, the sun is lowering. The nearly last shaft of light
looms across the ceiling  beams, turning the gold foil on the eastern wall into licks of fire. As
if to keep step the eulogy  turns apocalyptic and the Beast of Revelation is let out to play in
the darkness gathering around  the mourners'  heads. Then the streaming sun is abruptly
curtailed by the long dark curve of the  planet, and so, for the moment, is the Bishop. 
<P>
<I>
Hess was open eyed, and still is. He was a
student of history, knew its pratfalls, knew that its virtues and honoured
traditions were nothing more than puffs of smoke hanging over a battlefield, carried off
in  ragged order by the wind. Then, like so many others who think they've seen the light, Hess
made the  mistake of personalizing it, of stylizing his own actions and aphorisms and letting
the real complexity  vanish in the proliferating detail of paranoia. It's commona certain
intellectual arrogance that  becomes intoxicated with the amoral relativity of everything, but
substitutes an ego driven will that's  every bit as much a puff of smoke. Hess began with an
almost poetic sense of justice, naive and hopeful.  In the chaos he thought he could will at
least his own trajectory, which he envisioned passing close to  Nixon's and maybe stopping
there, in the kind of apocalypse foreseen by those self absorbed spokesmen  of god's plan
who immolate themselves and their followers to provide a beacon that throws the rest of  the
old, dead world into shadow. In this case the inspired geometry very nearly came true, seeing
as  how Nixon's private limo is probably leaving Nederland just about now and Hess lies
open eyed but  not seeing just a few miles off. Hell, if the plane hadn't broken up until a few
seconds later Hess might  have gone right through the roof of Nixon's chalet, killing him in
bed. History would have ended for  Nixon and Hess with the two of them in one another's
arms, not so strange bedfellows if you think on it.  It brings to
mind another of Hess's stories, probably fiction, but an example of those episodes of narrative justice Hess was so fond of. It seems Hess was contemplating working
for Mossad, the Israeli  secret service, in the early sixties. A prominent member of El Fatah
sleeping in the room next to his at  the Jerusalem Hilton was killed when a five hundred
pound Mossad assassin named Gypsy Saperstein suffered a cardiac arrest and
fell on him. Gypsy was a member of a troupe of overweight circus aerialists  
called The Flying Sapersteins, who thrilled crowds by cavorting eighty feet
above their heads, taunting  gravity and thrilling onlookers. That one of them would
eventually come down was as certain as a  sparrow falling. When Gypsy fell, God may have
been looking the other way but Hess wasn't. He left Jerusalem that night,
profoundly convinced he'd once more stood on the crosshairs of historical change. 
 </I> [This was a recurrent image with Hess. He never stepped on a cross or
went through a  crossroads without elaborate ritual. He once told me the Huron Indians
believed that when
children died their bodies must be buried where two paths crossed. Then,  if a woman
passed, their spirits could easily jump into her womb. Hess wanted no succubus jumping
into him.] 
<P>
Bo looks back
across his left shoulder towards the back of the church, where Hugo Weary Sr.  and
Theodora Everly Weary stand apart from the others in the pew most distant from
the  Bishop, and from the smiling and waxen simulacrum of their first son. Hugo Sr., in black
silk  suit and shiny black shoes, dazzles darkly, despite his effort at self effacement. Today
his son,  who has predeceased him, lies not stiller and quieter, ensconced in scarlet satin, than
the father  stands, half eclipsed in shadow at the rear of the church. Hugo's face betrays no
clue to his  thoughts, whether labyrinthine or as plain and lucid as a simpleton's. His
effacement is mirrored  by that of his wife, who ought to feel the loss more deeply and
hurtfully; but Hugo has her hand  imprisoned in his own, ensuring by slight but firm pressure
that grief is allowed to leave no more  than a fleeting impression on her mild, unlined face, or
in her eyes, blue faded cotton. No doubt  his mother, inside anyway, is crying Ralph back
home with the angels, like the little boy in the  Sunday School primer on his angelic knees
before gold streaming clouds; but if her silence  harbours a heartfelt prayer for her son then
she's pretty much alone. Nobody else liked Ralph  much, and as for heaven and his eternal
shining life, well, a Weary funeral, even as the great  Protestant God is called on to receive
the Weary ghost, pretty well ignores the mystery of the  unknown, a thing unquantifiable and
slightly indecent. No one in Ralph's family bar his mother,  certainly no one in the boardroom,
cares in the slightest whether there's a life after Ralph's short life on earth, only
that for the benefit of readers of The Montreal Gazette  and The Toronto
Globe & Mail, there appear to be. Like the pharaohs he will
glide in full panoply down the River of Death, loiter in Death's
anterooms, chat amicably with Death's servants, and maybe at the last  confront the
jackal headed god of the money changers, who'll weight his heart. Even Hugo  would see
the poetry of that.  
A lifetime later, in The City, Bo will come across a Patty Hearst
trading card and hang on to it  for luck. He always admired Patty, along with an anonymous
GM shareholder who gave much of his inherited fortune to the revolution. He
tore out a clipping about this multi millionaire from  <I>The New York
Times </I>and for years it was pinned to a bulletin board in his little 
office in the Katevale farmhouse, along with a line from Miguel Aruna: "The revolution: even at
its most  barbarous it is beautiful." In high school he liked to repeat Lenin's phrase about
having to break  eggs to make an omelette, for which Ralph laughed at him and one lackey of
the educational  system marked him down to a C  on a book report. He used the line, and
others, to infuriate his  father for a while, even though he believed it to be self serving and
sophistic. Even in college he  continued to expend as much energy trying to fight the
revolution from the expensive balcony  seats as he did helping to make even more money on
the backs of the Weary workers. He even  came to see a nice balance in this, though most of
the time he knew his life was based on  immensely destructive contradictions. When they
became unbearable he would put on old  clothes and work boots and drift around the dark
sides of cities, until they got too boring, or  dangerous, always making sure he kept his
American Express card hidden in his shoe, along  with the number of his father's lawyer. [I'm
telling you these things because the Robert Weary of this part of the story won't,
unless in some artful and reassuring draft of <I>Napoleon's Retreat</I>].
<P>
Still making dissonant connections, Bo
now sees a fullscale pageant of Ralph, Ralph looking  plumply and egregiously on, seated on
piles of multihued cushions, as Anubis racks his hollow breast for a heart that
ain't there. Brain, heart, testimonial as kids they screened 
<I>The Wizard of Oz</I> a dozen times together in the ballroom on the third floor, speculated
about one another's absent parts. Bo said Ralph was a crybaby, worse, a
heartless crybaby. Ralph said Bo made  everything too difficult and wrecked their
fun by feeling guilty / Ralph woke up screaming <I> it was there, I
swear, I could hear it thumping, Bo, help me Bo. </I>Bo couldn't wake up from his dreams,
and 
 if he did it turned out he was still dreaming, but somewhere else, in and of
another, forgetting his name and looking while his foreign hands crept everywhere, like in
a cheap horror flick,  fingering a keyboard that tinkled away, making a soundtrack for the
horrific slapstick of his  fears. It's Ellis gets the demons in the end, Bo projecting gothic
romances like mad, laying off the  horror like a bookie laying off a big bet, forcing others to
carry his crosses as the servants once  carried his bags for him when he was five and first
tried to run away from home. They drove  him to Windsor Station before he chickened out
and they drove him right back. Ralph never let  him live it down, but live he did while Ralph
chickened out bigtime and poor Bo's all alone.  Ralph won't go away, looking at him through
big terrified eyes as Mrs. Gianfridda enfolds him  in both her arms and makes soothing noises
while Bo stands fixed to a spot. All this is burned,  and burnished like a Rembrandt in his
memories, everything mute and gilt in the Mickey Mouse  nightlight, a pieta with Ralph the
hollow bellied Christ thrown across Mrs. Gianfridda's lap,  which he's too big for really, as
Christ was too big for the weeping women who held him. [And the innocent and unmarked
skin of his brother lying there is something he'll never be rid of, as it  remains the whole
substrate of his restless
dreams.]

Melba, the Toast of Elba 
</CENTER>
<P>
When the admen gather there is a worshipful
singing in the air, of price, product and the unholy  yoking of things to desires. Etienne Bliss
wants to come in sideways, slip down the row of plush  chairs tilted back, ignoring the
cheerful whistlers covering up their latest million dollar jingles,  just in case someone else
should catch a whiff of the four note sequence set to trigger a buying  frenzy in their targeted
slice of the consumer pie. Someday they'll all subconsciously betray their  cryptic birdsong,
simultaneously and randomly, and the secrets will be out. Until then Etienne  knows they will
continue to whistle covers, deceitful even to their own hearing. Etienne is privy  to several,
due to the empathic way he can decipher the tapping of pencil ends and the  6
syncopation of washroom bound ad execs, even when they're whistling dixie, or down
the wind, or whatever .... He picked up the tune in an electric instant one morning recently
when  Jake Subfusc strolled in, vibrating in a repeating five note sequence that Etienne
automatically tailored to a song he knew, in order to get at it: 
<I>da da da
DA duh, co pa ca BA nuh </I>. The song has words now, Jake's as it turned
out, whispered to Etienne over lunch. Etienne was secretly  disappointed to have to be told.
He would have cracked the code in time. Jake owned the  company, of course, so Etienne
was flattered. Etienne owed him one, Jake said, considering the Actualville
fiasco. <I> Her name was Melba, the toast of Elba </I>... the two of them whistled it for a
while until Etienne had it clear. (Other admen, passing, secretly construing
the secret whistling. It was  one bloody great musical cabal.) Etienne's fond of the song, the
transmutation, the possibilities.  Now he had someone to sell Ralph Weary's unsellable vodka:
Napoleon's last girlfriend, Melba.  For all Etienne knew there'd been no liason
between Napoleon and the sultry Elban, but the  vodka wasn't real either. It was a vile,
syrupy substance made from banana boat scrapings and  bottled by Bo's evil brother Ralph at
a cost to himself of pennies a gallon. Why the Subfusc  Agency dealt with Ralph, even
postmortem, has more to do with Bo's bad dreams about his  dead brother than anything.
Sometimes Bo acted as if Ralph wasn't dead, as if nobody was  really dead that was the
funniest thing. He continued, through Jason, to pay regular salaries  to a whole bunch of dead
people, which most of those who knew him thought was touching, but  which, Etienne was
certain, indicated Bo's leavetaking of his senses some time back ... just how  far back he
couldn't say, since after abolishing death Bo had abolished the passage of time and 
exiled himself to infinity ... / <I> he's been 
<P>
blankly staring </I>at his mother and father, so turns forward
again to the Bishop, who is a frozen tableau, both hands raised in the air,
face wearing an expression of rapture. The  histrionics are getting tiresome, seeming more
and more to be the same collection of empty riffs  that made up Ralph's life, but funereally
expressed. They might be parody, and if so contain an  implied critique of the way his brother
met his end. He laid violent hands on himself, as the  Bishop had put it to the assembled
family the night before, but so rich and varied are the 
stylistics of this insane ceremony that even those born to the manner would have no easy
time picking out the single note of disapproval, and from that the all pervading stink of
moral  censure. In the easy going boosterism of Ralph's small niche in the cathedral of
money, Bo can  discern the small signs of doubt: the flowers gathering out of the range of the
sun, or the way  darkness is allowed to play with Ralph's funeral furniture like a clumsy boy
with new toys.  Ralph will be interred in consecrated ground, but edging over towards a plot
thick with  penniless loonies who actually did turn out to be from the right kind of family,
when their  papers were checked. His final resting place will still be green and lovely, with a
wonderful view  of some vacant lots down below the mountain, where city buses gather to fill
the quiet morning  air with blue exhaust. [This graveyard is known as St. Mark's on the
Mountain, and was where  Monica and I met for the last time when I decided to go and live
in Geneva, giving up the myth of me and Monica together. This happens after
most of the story of <I> Napoleon's Retreat </I> and anyway
Monica gave up on the myth way before. Except for her unaccountable presence in The  City,
Monica is as gone as Ralph, as gone as Hess.] 
<P>

 Opening his eyes, as if from a long sleep, he's surprised to find
himself, body and mind, sitting  in a darkening church. But then he remembers. He's, oh, a
dozen rows from any other Weary, a  cathedral apart from his mother and father. He's not
sensible of anything much. The Bishop  drones inanely on, dwindled to little more than his
creamy, earnest voice, as powerful and easy  as the tide and about as intelligently directed.
Bo is a rock in its flow, a solidity, an unbelieving.  The ritual makes up in length for what it
lacks in conviction, but the words for Ralph are rising to high tide / <I> You're
a long time going, Ralphy, but you'll be a long time
gone </I>... / Ralph hated irreverence, sermonized often on Bo's perverse 
kind of humour. Bo called Ralph <I> Ralphy </I>, hardly ever <I> Ralph </I>
like the others did, and sometimes <I> Brother Ralph</I>, as if the
two shared holy orders. That's how Ralph viewed his stewardship of the
 business, as a calling, so the irony was lost on him. His ministry, until the unlucky suicide,
had
been devout. Well, the hell with it. Damned if I'll come along peaceable like, pardner, not in
this solemn opera ... and he begins to hum a western ballad, as old as the Gene Autry and
Bob Wills  sagebrush adventures he and Ralph used to have screened for them all Sunday
afternoon and night at Weary Manor / <I> I'm back in the saddle again, back
where a friend is a friend </I>/ but then  <I>Rock of Ages </I>falls with all its sad weight on the congregation, despite the efforts
of the rising organ swell to waft their thoughts heavenwards with Ralph. The
Oz mechanics behind the curtains  work to engage all senses in the final heartrending
sequence, grinding out colours, aromas and  fortissimos, for this is the moment the Bishop
has been building to. The crowd's emotion,  though, is more like relief. They are shuffling,
grumbling, stretching, raising perfunctory  hosannas, thoughts crossing to mundane matters
requiring their attention: money, kids, their  own backyards. And suddenly they're all standing
while he sits, dazed, with Jaqui beside him kicking at his legs / <I> I'm
sitting prostrate <P> with grief, </I> so help me,
Ralphy, and they're all stretched upright to the disappearing  sunshafts,
stalks of corn in a sullen hymnal wind stinking of lily-of-the-valley and impending  rain, grey
steady rain. Faded flowers, Ralph. Time reaps them, inevitably and without fanfare.  [The
grave portents at the end were added later. At the time I thought it was 
more like a scene from <I> The Music Man.]
  <P>
  The moon rose
soon, a palaeolithic Mona Lisa, bringing the Head once more into sight, a paleness rising 
 through dark water, a bright, dangerous object from beyond Lethe. It has been
talking without moving  its lips, looks like, the first part of the monologue having issued from
the dark. Now the director chooses  to bring the light up slowly, confronting the audience
with the talker, static and bright and still delivering itself of slow thought and
moribund philosophies.</I> [The dead, in Jason Subfusc's campaign
 on behalf of a chain of crematoriums, are referred to as <I> the metabolically
challenged. Moribund </I>is good too. It suggests not so
much death as a slight inclination towards slow motion  asymptotically progressing to the
point at which the speaker will not make much more sense 
than your local small town politician. Hess still has charisma, dead slow though he may be,
and I was hanging on his every word. Ellis Rancourt told me not long ago that he had a
premonition  of The City when he was a young man. It was darkest winter and a bird flew in
the door of the  tavern in which he was sitting. The fifteen hour nights seemed eternal, that
winter, he said, and  he was sick on and off until midsummer. His wife was still alive, he said.
He thought of the  sparrow that flies through the meadhall, quickly in from the storm and out
again, signifying the  eyeblink of life on earth. But this bird flew in panicky arcs across the
mirror behind the bar and  dropped dead to the floor. One of the patrons pulled a flashlight
from his heavy coat, Ellis said, and shone it on the bird, which lay on its back,
a cautionary tale from <I> Who Killed Cock Robin?</I> Ellis tried to
tell me how it made him feel, but it came out haltingly, in an oblique  parable.
He was on a dark, becalmed sea, he said, no familiar constellations above, no way to  tell in
which direction land lay, just the cool touch of sea air on one side of his face, telling
him  which way the small wind blew. He heard someone crying his name, he said, then a light
shone  briefly on his face, which pounded with thick, inarticulate blood. Then he remembered
a play,  by Beckett he thought. Three people were imprisoned in urns, or barrels, it wasn't
clear. Each got  to speak of his, or her, life only when the spotlight shone on him or her
alone. Two women and a  man. A triangle. When the light blinked out the speaker fell silent,
perhaps never to speak again,  should the light not come back. All dead, they eternally
rationalized their lives, but only when  the light shone on them. When the light moved on they
had to stop. This went on forever, in the  play, and in real life it could go on until the director
decided the audience had had enough,  though most sane directors stopped after three or four
complete runthroughs, all randomly  tracked by the lighting technician, who held most of the
power in the production of the play.  The director never knew who spoke when or for how
long. The actors had no control at all. They  might be left in the darkness overnight, or
forever. That was how Ellis felt, he said, when the  man in the overcoat shone his light on the
fallen bird in the tavern, in a winter long ago. That  was his dream of The City, he said, as the
lights failed around us, as they do, flickered back on,  failed again. I was thinking not of Ellis,
of course, but of Hess. I thought he had been trying to
talk when the light from the moon fell on him, lifting his face out of the water, figure and
ground. I waited for words until the moon fell behind a mountain, and Hess lowered his
sad corpse  back into the flowing stream. A murmur of cold wind shook the high aspen
boughs. The words I  imagined Hess speaking, then, have become the words of Ellis
Rancourt, glumly talking of fallen  sparrows, at war -- like Hess -- with the horizon. He
tries to form speech, as Ralph did in his  nightmares, but as with Ralph I'll be waiting for
doomsday for the words to form themselves and fall from his
mouth.]
