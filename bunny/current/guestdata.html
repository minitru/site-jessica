<BR><BR>Just a postscript to my earlier query.  That URL
I mentioned the first time I signed your guestbook
has changed to http://www.theboss.net/pi/writing/rs
and the Miles poems have been taken off the site.
You can still link to other pieces in the series 
through the Nebula and other buttons. Also, the
book/installation has evolved into a performance
piece with full jazz band backing the readings. We
opened with it here this past month and hope to
polish things further.  If you ever do get around to
answering your e-mail, kindly let me know if the
Word 7.0 for Windows 95 attachments got through and 
whether you're interested in voice or live music to
go with the poems. I submitted the work last July
too, folks :-/  Is there anyone still embalming 
rabbits there or has the whole interprise become
an unlucky rabbit's foot?

Have a Happy New Year anyway. :-)

but am wondering if you are still afloat.  I
sent you some poems from my long poem sequence on
Miles Davis last July I believe ( am at work so I
can't lay my hands on the records ).  Also sent 
along a query, but never got a reply.  Time to
check your e-mail and put together a new issue
guys.  The whole point of the new technologies is
that they are supposed to speed things up. :-/

Dying to see a new issue and would love to find
myself among such august company, but if not, I'd
sure like to know soon.

Have a great holiday and then get cracking on
another brillian issue.Cheers!!

Good day,

As the author of the following, I am seeking contacts in connection with
publication/distribution of same through appropriate media.

"We, the Descendants..." has been posted to various web sites during the
past while and feedback is indicative of probable wide acceptance by
Canadians from coast to coast. Direct distribution by hand has also 
resulted in ready support and acceptance in the majority of test cases. 
 
  

Your guidance and advice would be welcomed and appreciated.


Your truly,

David R. Hayward

ph: (514) 624-4656

-------------------------------------------------------------------
We, the Descendants...

We, the descendants of Canada's Indigenous peoples, and its 
French and English founders, AND OF ALL OTHERS who joined 
together during later times to settle and help build this nation, 
stand in unity as witness to this pledge. 

Recognizing that Canada's provinces and territories have been 
built by distinct peoples whose mother tongues, heritage, values 
and cultures varied, we pledge in the name of Canada: 

To respect, to celebrate and to preserve such diversity,
lest a loss of identity suffers unto our descendants;

to embrace tolerance, equality, sharing and compassion
as the moral cornerstones of this great nation;

to bond together as one in the pursuit of dignity, health,
prosperity and happiness for all Canadians.

Let not conflicting ambitions, nor neglect, nor the passage
of time allow this pledge to be forgotten or ignored.

Long live this Canada we all share, now and forever
a land of diversity, tolerance and justice.


 David R. Hayward

Should you like and want to use any of the Miles poems I sent you, you may wish to link to my home page on Marlene Menard's Professional Informatics pages at http://www.leth-theboss.net/pi/writing/rs under the "Across Miles" button, or to the latest issue of ken Stange's Nebula, which features nine of the poems and Marlene's art.  Other material from the series is up on Snakeskin: A Poetry Webzine, and forthcomingon Treeline.

Anyway, enough for now; let me crusie the new pages!

All good things,

<BR><BR>I found you after 11 p.m. When thots are random anyway.
Kids are in bed, husband asleep and I smile.
Is it the quietness of reading something unique that delights me?
Who knows but keep on doing the bunny thing - whatever that is.

most of the stuff I see on the internet bores me to tears
after about 100 words, but I finished the whole thing 
(I feel like a little kid proud of his eating a whole

for which his mother substituted ice cream, I don't know,
maybe it his birthday or something.)  Anyhow...Hello.

Greetings!

Here is a review of your site that cybeRhyme has done of your site. It can be accessed at http://www.switchmag.com/1997/rhyme/rhyme1/revpro.htm .


It's A Bunny Magazine
http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/bunny/current/bunny.html 

   IT'S A BUNNY! (ODD - IT RATHER RESEMBLED A
   WEB-SITE...OH WELL...)

          The first thing I was struck with when I visited this site is its
   warm vibrant colours. No gray print on black backgrounds here - no
   fancy designs to obscure the text - major bonus points here (from
   someone who is all too used to tracking the mouse down someone's
   screen to highlight the text and make it readable...). It's all very
   meticulously arranged - links - bios of the contributors - a guestbook
   - back issue information - all very easy to find. These are all pluses in
   cutting down time and effort in locating things (the Calvinist in me,
   who thinks effort is necessary to achieve enlightenment, rebels - but
   doesn't he always, though?). As to the poetry section - again, very
   neatly set out and readable. I quite enjoyed the works of Ernest
   Slyman (pointillistic, small portraits of big things in small events)
   and Lance Blomgren (humour of a truly twisted nature in one poem;
   delicate, poetic sadness in another) - for some reason, Barry Spacks
   just did not connect with me - sorry. To sum up - It's A Bunny good -
   obscurantist sites bad!! 

   - Tim Murphy

Please give our site a reciprocal link on your links page at your earliest convenience.

Best Wishes!

Forgive the intrusion, folks, but this page suits me fine! At least a fellow can read
good things here. We are writers, we are artists...There ain't nobody
can steal that from us. Go on like that, Bunny. Tell
me about everything, give me the lowdown about the whole kabbodle 
(Machiavelli Junior: "The world is a kabbodle"). I've
already put the bookmark on your cage...er...on your page.

<BR><BR>Well it IS a bunny after all. I'm glad to see it and to partake of it. I hope to maybe actually come to you soon now that I know you are here with a bit-o-bun to share. I had a bunny once a long time ago, Mr. Bo Jangles. I still have a scar on my left wrist from him. Gotta go... the dog needs me.

Should you like and want to use any of the Miles poems I sent you, you may wish to link to my home page on Marlene Menard's Professional Informatics pages at http://www.leth-theboss.net/pi/writing/rs under the "Across Miles" button, or to the latest issue of ken Stange's Nebula, which features nine of the poems and Marlene's art.  Other material from the series is up on Snakeskin: A Poetry Webzine, and forthcomingon Treeline.

Anyway, enough for now; let me crusie the new pages!

All good things,

Greetings!

Here is a review of your site that cybeRhyme has done of your site. It can be accessed at http://www.switchmag.com/1997/rhyme/rhyme1/revpro.htm .


It's A Bunny Magazine
http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/bunny/current/bunny.html 

   IT'S A BUNNY! (ODD - IT RATHER RESEMBLED A
   WEB-SITE...OH WELL...)

          The first thing I was struck with when I visited this site is its
   warm vibrant colours. No gray print on black backgrounds here - no
   fancy designs to obscure the text - major bonus points here (from
   someone who is all too used to tracking the mouse down someone's
   screen to highlight the text and make it readable...). It's all very
   meticulously arranged - links - bios of the contributors - a guestbook
   - back issue information - all very easy to find. These are all pluses in
   cutting down time and effort in locating things (the Calvinist in me,
   who thinks effort is necessary to achieve enlightenment, rebels - but
   doesn't he always, though?). As to the poetry section - again, very
   neatly set out and readable. I quite enjoyed the works of Ernest
   Slyman (pointillistic, small portraits of big things in small events)
   and Lance Blomgren (humour of a truly twisted nature in one poem;
   delicate, poetic sadness in another) - for some reason, Barry Spacks
   just did not connect with me - sorry. To sum up - It's A Bunny good -
   obscurantist sites bad!! 

   - Tim Murphy

Please give our site a reciprocal link on your links page at your earliest convenience.

Best Wishes!

Forgive the intrusion, folks, but this page suits me fine! At least a fellow can read
good things here. We are writers, we are artists...There ain't nobody
can steal that from us. Go on like that, Bunny. Tell
me about everything, give me the lowdown about the whole kabbodle

already put the bookmark on your cage...er...on your page.

<BR><BR>REALLY liked the art.  Glad to find the nude on the poetry page.  Any zine with "Bunny" in its title should have some shapely buttocks, or mammary glands.  For the small quantity of poems, they struck me as interesting, and of quality.  I look forward to another visit.
