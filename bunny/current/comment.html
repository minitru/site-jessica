Well, the Spring issue came out pretty close to the Summer, and the
Fall issue vanished into a haze of something or other, so apologies
to all who've suffered from our lack of organization.  But the Bunny
trudges on, bringing amusement in its wake.  Welcome back.
<BR><BR>
We've got no animated GIFs, no java or javascript, no Shockwave,
and not a frame in sight!  No FrontPage here; the Bunny is entirely
original, every button and background handcrafted, right down to the HTML.
Keep the bandwidth low, the quality high, and try not to get in the 
way of the art.

Lust, fame, violence, envy, and intrigues literary and criminal - and
that's just the novel excerpt!
<P>
This issue features art from the Northwest Territories and a new and local
(no less) Superhero who could be anywhere by now.  We are happy to report
that most of the poetry section came to us via the net. Proof that years of
toil are not ultimately  meaningless, nor are manuscripts read only by
close relatives and current lovers.

I've somehow found myself entangled in this Bunny thing--don't ask about
the name--after a threatening phone call, months ago, demanding one of
my stories for the last issue or be spammed into oblivion. Happily
entangled, I might add.  It's been great fun working with Sean and
Jessica so far, and I look forward to many more issues and maybe even a
salary someday.  Can't help but be pleased with the current
issue--finally out!--and vow to unearth more of the work of Ed Ward for
my own pleasure. For those of you reading, and thinking of sending your
masterworks in for consideration, do it now.  Another issue is already
in the works.  Really.
