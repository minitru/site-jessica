During the storms of my seventh year, I learned to swim in the basement.
The pipes all cracked and water filled the room like one of Father's bad
tempers. I was a very late beginner. Mother bailed aimlessly as I learned
to frog-kick and crawl, her thick thighs safely within reach. Jellyfish
stung our limbs and sea-gulls dove from the rafters to peck at the seaweed
on our heads. "Everything's all broke," Mother sighed as she tried to
rescue the little logs of corn that floated around us for dinner. My small
body was as purple as the rings under her tired eyes. Upstairs, Father
paced, his raging getting louder. That year I became a champion swimmer.
Mother threw me fish to help me grow and become strong.
