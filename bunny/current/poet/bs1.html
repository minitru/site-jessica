                    THIS JUST IN

Anna has given up writing,
who said that using garlic to cook for her father
came close to bringing a prostitute home for supper;
who notes that trying and failing and trying again
is like taking your rest in a bathtub full of potatoes.

Anna the story writer is no longer writing.

Instead she prays with the others at 6 a.m.,
drives her white pick-up with Christmas-tree-lights round the rim,
cleans the kitchen and johns at the Buddhist center
and sits on her cushion in straight-backed equestrian style
with feet in white socks tucked neatly in tight-crossed legs.

Anna the story writer has giving up writing.

In most of her works the people are looking for joy,
a bit unclear as to where it's been hidden away.
Her adults act like children, her children "make out"
then afterwards moan "I can't believe I did that!" 
Mainly they're girls, eating much or not at all,
 
unhappy, but what can they do? Anna's given up writing

(for the moment, at least, though she prays it will last forever,
this freedom it gives her, this suddenly vast mind-space).
She looks like she's ready to fly now her mind's filled with nothing,
no six ton sack on her shoulders -- that's joy in her face
as she spins at the May Faire swirling on the grass, 

Anna who pondered the need "to sweeten life,"

who told wry tales of those who try and fail,
who can't stop speaking words - a lot of them funny -- 
who wants to grow wise yet keeps on acting crazy, 
who spins at the May Faire in pre-flight ecstasy:
Anna the story writer who's given up writing.
