The words in their new suits and tie,
The tender words in high heels,
The Mad men of a perfectly mad sentence,
The clever words, the reckless words,
The sad words in black leather jackets and gloves,
The small print words that stand on the corner,
Painted faces like prostitutes,
The books on a shelf like rows of old houses,
Dark brothels in which words
Conduct business, the words with their hands out,
Words with their bellies full of sadness,
Words that jump off high buildings
And words that give off a lovely light,
Words breaking their words. 

East Tennessee, 1968

Our thoughts are like broken furniture,
Hurled in anger against the quiet,
Stirring past some queer yard. 
Morning and the paganism of black coffee,
The sky all bursting with light,
The old man sheds its skin. Last night
Quietly knocking in our bones
The queer tremors of seven o'clock,
And there has risen in the oven a human face,
Dark plunges half-way across the room
A hand pries loose a jelly jar, spreads
Thick the goodness on rye toast.


**************
Origin of the Species


Morning voices hold us briefly,
Letting us go on our way
When the sunlight touches the first fish,
Her tail glimmering like something
Terribly rare---perhaps never seen
On the planet, now suddenly everywhere,
Accepting itself as different,
Though very much a part of us,
Older somehow by being new.
The moment it was forged into being
We cringed, thinking how could this be,
Accepting its bizarre feeding habits,
Its four legs allowing it to crawl
Upon the surface. And now we read
In Nashville, Tennessee, one was caught,
Trained to sing for a roadside inn,
Cracking jokes with the tourists,
All joyous, biting down on pears
And apples and peaches. We wish we could
Listen to that singing fish.
Ain't it something the way Gershwin
Comes out all sweet as you please.
Wish I could sound that good.
Nothing ever comes out
Like you think it will.
Even the birds know that,
And the fish jump at the lake
For almost nothing. Their splashes
Take off where we leave off.
Those are last words out there,
Rippling to ever-widening circles,
Touching the rocks on the bank
And telling them to wait their turn.
