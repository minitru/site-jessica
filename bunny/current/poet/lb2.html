Autumn had taken over the household. The leaves piled over the windows,
drowning the sound of Father's cough with their crackling. "We're losing,
we must fight on," my mother said during one of our pep-talks. She handed
me the silver rake from its case. I battled madly as the wind turned the
sky brown and covered my body in tiny crumpled skeletons.  Leaves stuck
between the stiff prongs of the rake like clumps of dry hair in my father's
comb. Inside, the weather made him weaker. "It's October, things die," said
Mother, comforting me after Fall's Great Offensive. We fought alone for the
rest of the season, cracked leaves in the war-torn house until flames leapt
from our hands.
