Window-framed sharkskin sky.  Sharp spring wind biting through the
plastic taped to a triangular hole in the glass pane.  Kev is
rolling onto his back and scratching his balls.  Scratching what
wakes first.  Rising to untape the plastic and pee out the window. 
Nor shaking it out for to do so would court castration, a bit
sharper than that of any wind.  Piss pooling on the window ledge
outside then seeping into the concrete, spare drops dribbling over
the edge.
<P>
The doorbell is ringing and Kev struggles into his last pair of
jeans, with their rip at the crotch that puts him at risk for an
indecent exposure charge.  Kev is peeping through the spy-hole. 
Not the bald head of the short, stocky landlord.  Kev is pulling
the chain loose from its track, rattling the lock open and opening
the door.  Kev is looking up at Patty's new haircut - a brown bob
- and Patty is reaching out to grab the penis drooping out of
Kev's jeans, giving it a firm shake, saying, "Hi, how are ya,
pleased to meetcha."
<P>
Kev is stumbling back, slapping her hand away and she is marching
in with a briefcase, letting it barely bounce on the raw foam that
Kev sleeps on.  Patty is sitting and crossing her nude-stockinged
legs.  Sitting on the old plaid armchair, leaning back against the
spray paint spelling out "Mr. Chair" across the rough fabric. 
Dust is rising and falling, moth breath.  Kev is bending to open
the briefcase, finding glossy travel brochures and a photo of Bugs
Bunny advertising Reg Hartt's cartoon revival.  On the back, a
scrawled outline of all the steps of their khat run to England
tomorrow morning.
<P>
Quickly, across Kev's inner landscape, a toy plane circling the
ceiling, an empty suit saying, "Bond.  James Bond," and his lips
catching dark stars in the constellation of freckles on Patty's
shoulder.
<P>
Kev is running his hand through his new short haircut, his fingers
twirling in their surprise at avoiding tangles.  Kev is saying, "I
don't know about this, I don't know."
<P>
Patty is saying, "Look under the brochures and files.  Look."
<P>
Kev is letting his fingers do the looking, pulling out a clip-on
tie, a button-down striped shirt and tan pants.
<P>
Patty is saying, "Try them on, go on."
<P>
Kev is laying the clothes out on the foam, first the shirt, then
the pants over it so that the shirt looks like it is tucked into
the waistband of the pants, then the tie covering the shirt
buttons.  He is trying to see himself lying on the foam inside of
these clothes but he is falling.  He sits cross-legged on the
floor, absent-mindedly squeezing a zit on the hairy thigh exposed
by another tear in his jeans.
<P>
Patty lights a cigarette for him.  Then one for herself.
<P>
Kev is picturing himself in a natty gangster suit, a fedora
shadowing his thick-lashed blue eyes, sucking on a cigarette held
between the first fingers and the thumb, it tasting first of burnt
marshmallows, then of fried bacon, and finally of dank radiator
steam.  Patty in a tight red dress with a marcelled wave framing a
white face with a cranberry pucker, saying, "How about it, big
boy?" and blowing him a cherubic kiss.
<P>
Kev is bending over to pick up the shirt and Patty is getting a
full view of the dark hairs on his ass frowning over his red-rimmed googly 
balls.  Patty is laughing and Kev is biting his lip
as he buttons his shirt all wrong and reaches for the pants,
throwing them over his shoulder as he bends again to unzip and
struggle out of his jeans.
<P>
Those new pants, what pants they are.  A firm waistline, gently
pleated, rippling into generous pockets.  Bagging with saucy
insouciance at the crotch and ass.  Narrowing evenly down the legs
to the perfect width of crisp, stalwart cuffs.  Pants that say
Clark Gable, Ernest Hemingway, African safaris, French fishing
villages, stream-lined curvaceous automobiles.  Patty gets a new
picture of Kev strolling barefoot on a clean, white beach, blowing
his nose into a clean linen handkerchief, rolling up his sleeves
to hurl smooth pebbles into surging ocean swells.  Kev saying,
"How about it, Patty-pie?" and picking her up to wade them both
into the lapping blue water.
<P>
Kev does not know what Patty is picturing.  Patty does not know
what Kev is picturing.  And so, in this moment, they do not know
each other.  For each is only the reach of their respective
desires and the frustration of the impossibility of those desires. 
In this time, between staying and leaving, between the defined
past and the indefinite future, between former selves and selves
that they will become, they don't even know themselves.  They know
only that they desire selves that will come to them easily,
without the slightest effort beyond the range that their limited
purchasing power will allow.
<P>
"These are some fine pants," Patty is whistling, "Let's go get a
jacket and shoes and then go celebrate your new pants."
<P>

Patty is leaving the dark apartment with a forty-ounce bottle
containing only two fingers of scotch.  Sighing loudly.  And
yelling, "I'll pick you up at six and you better be ready,
asshole."
<P>
Kev is dreaming.  Dreaming of Patty the way she looked before this
week.  Long, thin, green braids.  Purple lipstick.  Overalls cut
into shorts.  Black long-johns.  Grey work socks with flirtatious
red stripes.  Patty with yellow teeth and chapped lips, licking
his clavicles.  Patty squatting to pee on broken glass in the
alley behind the bar.  Patty shaving her legs in the fountain at
Queen and University, her legs bright silver and dorsal in the
sprays of light cascading a lacy swath through the darkness.
<P>
Kev is dreaming beyond memory, dreaming of a Kev unknown.  A Kev
in black cowboy boots and hat, lying in the back seat of a black
Riviera and drinking Jack Daniels.  Patty singing, "I killed a man
in Reno just to watch him die," and shooting out the driver's seat
window into vulnerable cacti.  A Kev in black leather pants
straddling a mike stand and howling.  Patty butting the neck of a
red guitar into his hip.  A Kev in a black turtleneck, slouching
in a smoky cafe and writing words like "Fellatio grin of the moon"
in black scrawls across damp napkins.  A naked Kev, rolling in
black paint across a white-clad Patty and signing his name on her
palm.
<P>
Kev is dreaming beyond Patty, dreaming of a woman unknown.  A
woman with bristling red curls and a carnivorous smile.  Pouring
martinis and plopping olives into them.  The spray hitting her
sharp cheekbones.  Kev drinking martini after martini in the blue
velvet lounge.  Reaching into the pocket of his plaid suit jacket
for change and tossing it like darts into her downy cleavage. 
Singing, "You are my sunshine . . ." and swallowing the olives
whole.  Laying his head down in the ashtray and snoring.
<P>
Kev is snoring, he is beyond dreaming.  Beyond desire.  Beyond his
self.

Patty is pounding on the door.  Screaming, "Wake up you fuck, you
fucking fuck-up."
<P>
Kev is sleeping, fresh vomit on his face, fresh vomit on his new
pants.  Kev is dreaming again.  Dreaming of fins cleaving through
clean water, through fine sand, and through pressed tan fabric up
to the crotch.
