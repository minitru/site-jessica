<P>
     Even on his first day in town, Enr knew he'd made the
  right choice. Although he had the white male face of the
  Occupation, Enr gained an immediate confidence that, as a
  businessman, he would be able to sustain a bias in favour of
  these people, that this could be his community, his new home.
<P>
     Enr'd looked around. He felt people's desires deeply,
  and had a quick eye for the gaps that the Departments of
  Defence and Welfare were leaving in their lives. Within
  months nearly every opportunity he saw turned into a
  job-creating enterprise providing many honest days of work
  and regular paycheques for some of the people. His efforts
  helped a lot of them adjust to the rapid changes. In fact,
  wherever Enr went in the North, economic miracles blossomed.
  <P>
     This phenomenon did not go unnoticed. Shaman initiates
  from around the Rim were sent to Ulittaq for six-week
  apprenticeships with Enr in order to learn the value of
  money. At first the mentor job had bothered him. Carmen, for
  one, had asked him how he could advise other people's
  spirits? He'd actually decided to quit at one point, but
  Peter, the oldest and most northerly shaman, heard about his
  misgivings and made the trip to Ulittaq himself. He invited
  Enr to pray. Enr was nervous, but he went along. They cut the
  hole in the ice, built the iglu, and for the first time in
  his life, God appeared and spoke clearly to Enr, audibly, no
  mistake. And even though it wasn't his usual form of God, he
  felt better. 
<P>
     Enr's customary God, still the one and only
  Judeo-Christian-Islamic one but branching out, the one whom
  he still worshipped and studied a little each week at church,
  was rich and famous and allied to most of the capital in the
  world. He knew money flipside and down and continued to
  impress capitalists. They could feel in their bones His
  critical importance for money   far better than a gold
  standard by itself. Enr was disappointed that fat-assed
  capitalists knew God as a friend of cheap labour and could
  reliably follow His missionaries around the world to find it.
<P>
  God left capitalists and their capital pretty much alone. Enr
  thought Him too PR sensitive, not wishing to show Himself or
  speak to anyone but the poor unless it was to send an
  occasional fatass to Hell for complacency.
     <P>
     But, praying with Peter, God had surfaced as a woman.
  Enr felt very blessed, very hip: a touch of that Toronto club
  sex chill back in those heady days of monied arms-length
  cinema long ago. She wore metallic clothes   black anodized
  tights and a copper-green bra stitched in gold. Her hair was
  a bright red floating mass of salmon roe washed by ocean
  currents. Enr could only think Bay Street dike stepping out,
  but Peter guessed retro-Berlin, and a sweet nod of
  recognition passed between God and him. Her cigarette breath
  and bad teeth put Enr at ease. She was straightforward and
  sympathetic, squeezing his leg and whispering in his ear. She
  wanted in, she said, the slavery be damned. Finance my
  people, she said. She took him over the ocean: I give you the
  whole shore. Go to all the Rim and make consumers, she
  demanded. She took him down to her abode: How could you hurt
  us more than you already have, you kind generous man? she
  cooed. That's true, I will, he promised. Scissor-legged and
  arm-locked, they floated and bumped along the ceiling above
  her bed.
     <P>
     Goodness had followed Enr all the way to Ulittaq,
  positioning him ideally between army and people, where by
  God's mercy he had prospered. Whose God's mercy? He dared not
  tell which. Therefore Enr dedicated his entrepreneurial
  talents to meeting this latest demand from this version of
  God, the One who had touched him and spoken directly to him,
  and with whom he'd experienced his first underwater orgasm,
  at the bottom of the sea, something he'd dreamed of. Even
  Peter was impressed.
     <P>
     The shaman recruits were quick to tap Enr's power to
  generate accounts receivable, some making horrible mistakes
  with the money hard-won from the ministries, others finding
  brilliant ways to get the money into people's hands, to bring
  them joy while disguising it as the ruinous frivolity that
  southern taxpayers wished to believe it was.
     <P>
     One of Enr's students, Donnie's brother Ray, commanded
  a small band of saboteurs bent on humiliating the Occupation.
  His training and deployment of bomb technicians and sharp
  shooters had raised his status with Commander Blakkap. By now
  they were each others best enemies, a co-dependency sparking
  deadly cat and mouse strategies between them. Enr could only
  nod his head when Donnie brought news of Ray's movements. He
  was jealous.
     <P>
     But Enr knew that he himself was too wired for kindness
  to be a terrorist. His own gift was actually larger and
  meaner, his abilities more like those of a director of
  monetary policy at a governing bank who can spend the
  imagined money. When he dug deeper into his dreams all he
  wanted was to turn this skill into cinema. Cinema for high
  culture, TV for low, these were the weapons he longed to
  wield against the enemies of earth and God. But the studio he
  needed was, practically speaking, still a few years off,
  barring some magic stroke. So Enr settled for the warmer
  cruelties allowed a middle-class businessman and supplemented
  his desire for more grandiose wickedness with the prestigious
  position of world-liaison officer at his church.
  <P>

   <B>Hollywood North</B>. Where you can see someone else as yourself
  in a movie:
   <P>
     <B>the shoot:</B>  Say you're out on the land looking for wolf.
       Qamutiik's balanced and tracking well. The 2-cycle buzz of
       the machine feels good on the ass because the pressure's
       high and you're clamped to the wind cruising at forty
       kliks average all night on less fuel than you thought
       possible at minus fifty. You decide to go for that patch
       of sticks Mike said was there three days west and that
       means thirty-six hours of steady cruising. Count on it,
       because Mike never shit his worst enemy with data like
       that. So there'd be foxes too, and this is going to be
       your year to snare that heap of pelts. A good blow comes
       along making the work easy and the carcasses start lying
       around the machine like scattered bodies, and say you get
       hit, not from a stupid accident, careless with the weapon,
       or the pack catches you and tears you up or something like
       that, but say it's two F-18s, they know you're out there.
       One cruising high picks up you or your machine's heat and
       the other one, cruising low, spots you, rolls over and
       over in glee, and before you can load your weapon for him
       or her, makes the turn and the hit, and adds your body to
       the others.

Who cares? Enr does.

  <B>shoot.</B> Hunter-mom and maybe-hunter-to-be-kids watch TV
       snug in the plywood drift-manacled heat-heated dwelling in
       town just watching TV together waiting for hunter-man to
       come home with the dancing wolves and they all blow up
       because the oldest brought home a mine. It's early in the
       occupation and the school has not yet received the
       pamphlet, "Mines and Your Health," from the Ministry of
       Mines and Health, and snow collapses onto the fire.

  <B>shoot.</B> The hacking and scratching at the ice to get 'em
       out.
       <P>
       
       <B>a short take.</B> The funerals, with a time shift to when
       ground and bodies can reasonably be expected to thaw
       for burials. A few holes, maybe May....
