       ...and they all blow up
       because the oldest brought home a mine. It's early in the
       occupation and the school has not yet received the
       pamphlet, "Mines and Your Health," from the Ministry of
       Mines and Health, and snow collapses onto the fire...

I once heard her
say that the only thing that went with speed was more speed. And Jack with his
car made the perfect match. If there's something to be had, you can be sure the
Father has it. And like he says, he's always happy to share the magic with his
friends...

"It's easy," Steven reassured her, "You tell us two things. One
lie, one truth, and we try to guess which one's which. Pretty straight

eyes on Lady J. River lit a cigarette and slowly exhaled smoke in

Those new pants, what pants they are. A firm waistline, gently
pleated, rippling into generous pockets. Bagging with saucy
insouciance at the crotch and ass. Narrowing evenly down the
legs to the perfect width of crisp, stalwart cuffs.
Pants that say Clark Gable, Ernest Hemingway, African safaris...
