Multi-media launch of new Montreal based Internet literary
magazine with special guest!
<P>
The official launch of <I><B>it's a bunny</B></I> will be hosted by award
winning poet <B>Gary Geddes</B> featuring readings by <B>Grant Loewen</B>,  
<B>Bee MacGuire</B> and other fine Montreal writers, interspersed with
commentary by our special guest: the computer. Readings will be
accompanied by the energetic images of artist <B>Karin Szlagowski</B>. 
<I><B>It's a bunny</B></I>, live and on-line at <B>Bistro 4</B> for two hours of
dazzling interactive wordplay on March 18 at 8:00.
<P>
<I><B>It's a bunny</B></I> provides shelter for fine new English fiction,
poetry, and art in an otherwise cold and brutal climate. This is
an independent endeavour for the artistic community whose aim is
to provide international exposure for fine work at this time of
economic crises in the print industry.  <I><B>It's a bunny</B></I> has already
been linked to recognized literary magazines including Grain and
The Cat Machine.   
<P>
<B>Bistro 4</B> (4040 St-Laurent Blvd) is known for its commitment to the
Montreal literary community. Over the past few years <B>Bistro 4</B> has
provided sanctuary for local writers, a place to hear and be
heard.  But this is no ordinary launch filled with the sound of
paper crinkling between nervous fingers. <I>On March 18, the computer
talks back. </I>
<P>
Visitors are invited to explore the website, interact with the
computer, provide commentary, and get videobooked. 
<P>
The pre-release is available at:  <B>http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/bunny/</B>
