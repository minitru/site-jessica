</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Reading Michael Ondaatje's <I>The Collected Works of Billy the
Kid</I> is an exercise in the aesthetic of 'thinking going its own
way'.  Through his various histories of Billy the Kid, Ondaatje
unleashes the story of the artificer, ironically metaphorized as
the notorious murderer; he who must destroy in order to attain
enlightenment, and he who seeking enlightenment, merely destroys. 
In casting Billy the kid as creator/artist and the wild west as
the canvas, Ondaatje both underscores and undermines the romantic
associations of the gunslinger and of the artist.  Even as he
suggests how perception and artistic vision are free and wild
forms existing without boundaries, Ondaatje points to the bizarre
trappings of that vision of the sublime.
     <P>
     Ondaatje's imagistic and journalistic narrative charts the
artist's (Billy's) approach to, and collapse into, sensation,
color, texture - where perception and perspective magnify to
render sublime the details of the phenomenal world.  Ondaatje
applies a metaphorics of vision, doubleness and excess to create
this sublime. 
     <P>
     Ondaatje uses a third person narrator to directly address the
reader and to establish an relation of intimacy between reader and
character.

               Not a story about me through their eyes then. 
Find the 
               beginning, the slight silver key to unlock it, to
dig it out, 
               Here then is a maze to begin, be in. (20)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The intriguing nature of the address enables the reader to
participate, not only in the tale of Billy the Kid, but in the
discovery of it (the beginning), the unlocking.  The reader is
asked to 'be in' the text both as a participant and observer.  
     Ondaatje's language entices the reader's continued attention
through its compelling movement between the familiar or prosaic
and the iconographic.  The reader, rather than being alienated by
the murderer's perspective, finds herself allied with the artist's
aesthetic vision.  This understanding is created through the
magnifying of mundane detail and a rendering of objects as icons. 
Ondaatje's use of simple, oblique description makes the language a
seductive environment to 'be in'.  Inanimate objects and
substances are vitalized when coupled with verbs:  "Neck sweat
eating at my jeans" (11), magnifies actions of the insensate world
and equates it to the world of human actions, of hostile actions. 
This double move towards animation, through a language of
violence, saturates the poetry.  This perspective which animates
also violates within the piece:  moral vision is suppressed, the
aesthetic vision is all that matters, all there is to see.
     <P>
     Though the motif of perception transcends simple reference to
physical sight it is dependant on it and character's ability to
perceive is clearly linked to physical vision.  Ondaatje
repeatedly uses forthright references to 'seeing' and to what is
seen:
     <P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE>
               Snow outside.  Wilson, Dave Rudabaugh and me.  No
windows,
               the door open so we could see.  Four horses
outside. (22) 
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
     The short sentences and listing of details confine the
narrator's visual field.  This limitation outlines division: 
hence two of the text's governing tropes -- partial vision and the
division of interior and exterior.  The trope of outside and
inside is heavily knitted into the work;  interior is associated
with internal perception or personal vision whereas the exterior
includes the material, surfaces, and the chaos of the external
world.  Of the two categories of sight, it is a focus on the
internal which is the key to enlightenment for the artist.  The
physical body is the site where the split between internal and
external worlds becomes difficult to sustain.  Through repetition
of symbolic words and inversion Ondaatje illustrates these
tensions in the following passages:      
<P>

<P>
     It seems the act of looking cannot occur without some
implication in its object.  The look changes and inverts.  The
destruction of the body is the realization of the artists' desire
for interior vision.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               I am here with the range for everything <BR>
               corpuscle muscle hair<BR>

               that listen to deep buried veins in our palms (72)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     The doubling of desires that 'want to crash things with an
axe' and that 'listen to deep buried veins' maintains the violence
accompanying the desire to hear an internal language.  This sense
perception uses destruction as a pathway to the interior.  It is
also the key to a kind of knowledge.  When Angela's hand is shot
open, Billy removes the bullet and examines the wound:
<P>
	       <BLOCKQUOTE>
               look at it, i'm looking into your arm<BR>
               nothing confused in there<BR>
               look how clear<BR>
               Yes Billy, clear (66)<BR>
	       </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     This correlating desire for the destruction of the body, the
physical, the external, and the viewing of the internal, shows
internal perception as a pure form.  Ondaatje produces this
correlation by repetitive use of the words "clear" and "pure" when
describing interiors as well as when depicting Billy's physical
vision.  Sallie Chisum's narrative describes Billy as a "good
looking, clear eyed-boy" (52).  The relationship between
destruction and pure perception produces the optic; the ocular as
the sublime.
     <P>
     Purity of the internal, the sensory, also suggests purity in
vision understood as the goal of the artist.  As the narrative
focuses on the internal, sentences lose formal structure,
punctuation, and the language becomes more free form (the pen
"mapping my thinking going its own way" (72)).  For instance,
during Billy's 'sun-fever' he imagines a hand searching his
physical self: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Down the long cool hand went scratching the freckles and warts in
my throat breaking through veins like pieces of long glass tubing,
touched my heart with his wrist, down he went the liquid yellow
from my busted brain finally vanishing as it passed through soft
warm stomach like a luscious blood wet oasis, weaving in and out
of the red yellow blue green nerves moving uncertainly through
wrong fissures ending pausing at cul de sacs of bone then
retreating slow leaving the pain of suction then down the proper
path through pyramids of bone that were there when I was born,
through grooves the fingers spanning the merging paths of medians
of blue matter, the long cool hand going down brushing cobwebs of
nerves . . . (76-77)
     </BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     The internal becomes a world in itself, with pathways, oases,
pyramids and cul de sacs.  In contrast to imagist passages earlier
in the text, the above passage enacts the artist's loss of self in
internal landscapes; the loose grammatical structure suggests the
proliferation of images as abandon into the perceptive world. 
Ondaatje's emphasis of inanimate structures is colored by the
clumping of adjectives and nouns to form descriptions of the
sublime ('luscious blood wet oases'.)
     <P>
     The aesthetic of the sublime is doubled in Ondaatje's
blending of the iconography of birds and vision, frequently in a
single image.  Birds in literature are often associated with
transcendence, and/or a universal, all-encompassing perspective,
(i.e. "a bird's eye view").  Billy marks the importance of the
symbol when examining a dead bird:
     <P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE>
               Held it in my fingers<BR>
               the eyes were small and far<BR>
               it yelled out like a trumpet<BR>
               destroyed it of its fear (14)<BR>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
     But for all the symbolic weight of the bird image the
creature in Billy's hand is dead; its eyes small and unseeing. 
Later, Ondaatje associates sun and moon as birds, their status as
signifiers of vision are linked with the threat of blindness:
 <P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
               and the sun a flashy hawk

               and you look up and moon a frozen bird's eye (26)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

     The bird symbol is the transcendent, but it is a
transcendence which negates itself.  The promise of sight is
threatened.  The contrast of sun hawk and frozen eye also suggests
the conflict at the heart of the artist's agenda; to image the
world, to freeze it.  
     <P>
     Billy describes the owls in the dark cages with acute detail
to their eyes  "All I could see were its eyes -- at least 8"
apart" (37).  Later he realizes that his perception was altered
and that his vision was actually of two birds, each blind in one
eye.  He describes birds as "moving and sensing the air and our
departure.  We knew they continued like that all night while we
slept" (37),  Birds as sensual perceptive creatures actually
embody the threat of blindness posed within the promise of
perceptual acuity.
     <P>
     The idea of frozen or vivisecting vision recurs when Billy
suffers hallucinations.  As he stares into the sun he explains
that  "nothing breaks his vision".  He also realizes: "if I hold
up my finger  I blot out the horizon"  (74).  In this scene he
seems master of his perception, able to control and alter what he
sees, painting the canvas before him.  Ondaatje emphasizes the
danger posed by the artificer by likening Billy to mythic Icarus,
son of Daedalus:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               I am here on the edge of sun<BR>
               that would ignite me<BR>
               looking out into pitch white (75)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Though he nears the sun he realizes his hands are empty and
returns 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               to where weapons are<BR>
               is planned by my eye (75)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The eye is roving but paralyzed.  Billy's artistic tools are
weapons.  Enlightenment lies in destruction of the external.  He
fixates on a boy who is able to block out light and notes his
appearance,  "face young like some pharaoh".  The godlike figure
is able to control art whereas Billy, without his weapons, remains
catatonic:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               I am unable to move<BR>
               with nothing in my hands. (75)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

     This is the risk facing the artist, the doubleness of vision
and blindness, of innovation and destruction, of communication and
silence.  New vision and fresh perception will not arise without
some form of destruction.  Only in the moment of death or
destruction might the sublime be grasped.  Billy has some
indication of this when he watches Charlie Bowdre dying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               while the eyes grew all over his body (12)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Multiple vision suggests multiple perspectives and this
multiplication recalls of the sublime.  The dying body sprouts
eyes which are also wounds.  Sight and blindness are bound up as
one.  Ondaatje separates and isolates this sentence example after
a detailed description of Bowdre's death to reinforce the
phenomena of vision as an intrinsic proliferation in the moment of
physical destruction.
     <P>
     Ondaatje's production of the sublime was both enabled and
defined by his awareness of the tension between the bizarre and
the mundane.  A foreshadowing of this conflict is found early in
the piece when Billy describes his moral vision:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
               so if I had a newsman's brain I'd say<BR>
               well some morals are physical<BR>
               must be clear and open<BR>
               like a diagram of watch or star<BR>
               one must eliminate much (11)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

     Neither Billy or Ondaatje have a newsman's brain; it is the
narrator who tells us that morals are physical and as actions
morals are clear.  Throughout the piece we have seen that which is
clear became clear through destruction, by delving into the
interior, and gaining perception that is also a devastation.  In
order to attain this clear form, 'one must eliminate much'.  In
the same way Ondaatje eliminates many of the elements of
conventional prose.  Still, unlike Billy or Icarus, Ondaatje is
not destroyed by his approach of the sun.  The vacillation between
the familiar and the fantastic, allows him to approach the sun and
withdraw, there is a fresh narrative voice at play after the
description of Billy's death:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is now early morning, was a bad night.  The hotel room seems
large.  The morning sun has concentrated all the cigarette smoke
so one can see it hanging in pillars or sliding along the roof
like amoeba.  In the bathroom, I wash loose nicotine out of my
mouth.  I smell smoke still in my shirt. (105)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The artists project is suddenly less self-annihilating than a
night of drunken illusions.  Despite the hangover, his thoughts
are not empty, he sees the ghost of an amoeba within the smoky
wake; a creature which forms new life out of self destruction.
