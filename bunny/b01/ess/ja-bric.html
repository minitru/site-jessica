     <I>Brick, Looking Up</I> begins and ends with us peering into a
computer screen, looking for salvation.  Sandwiched between the
title and the last word is a collection of characters and their vain
efforts to facilitate this longing.  Experience is filtered through
the blind eye of the computer screen. Illuminated light fragments
dart across a computer face, arrange and define experience, finally
injecting themselves into the story of the workings of the universe. 
<P>
     The narrator is a self-proclaimed redactor freed from the
constraints of asserting reliability.  Historical interpretation of
fact is portrayed as undependable in the new order.  Set in the
abyss of post apocalyptical end-time, each individual's story
petitions a way out of the void through a new genre, a thematic
arrangement of fact, an acknowledgement of the process of
selectivity.  
<P>
     Two highly contradictory modes of organisation inform this
work.  Although the intellectual call to a new order is supported by
the novel's fragmentary structure, the substantial usage of biblical
references somewhat undermines the work's originality.  It is no
accident that Joycean motifs resonate in this call for an inquest
into the protocol and orchestration of the word.  The authorization
for a rewrite seems to come from both God and Joyce.  The wrath of
the misrepresented is the palpable force that guides this work. 
Jesus the historical celebrity sanctions this force.  He beseeches
the reader to recognize his imperfections, to excavate his humanity
buried and bowed beneath twenty centuries of distortion culminating
in the final blasphemy of the rubric text.  Escape is both crafted
and expedited through the new technological language of the
computer.
<P>
     Each of the main male characters have been re-christened with
names that expose  their marginalization.  Bricks are heavy,
associated with density, dullness, confined by and made up of the
terrestrial.  Brick, looking up, suggests a longing for being other
than it is, for lightness and luminosity.  The name of the book
suggests the potential for emancipation, the possibility of escape.
<P>
     Wired (extracted from Wendel) suggests that we are in the
presence of a vivid and frustrated current.  He spends his intensity
in the building and fusing of practical objects.  Xed is spelled
like a cancellation as in X'ed or crossed out and pronounced like
the last letter in the alphabet.  His status as hero athlete has
been revoked by virtue of his accident. These given names were too
mainstream and inclusive to define their roles and so were withdrawn
from the text as obsolete.  
<P>
     The computer, although nameless, is the personality that
confers authority and provides focus when words fail the nominal
authors of text. In effect, it is the new amanuensis of the
redactor, as yet unestablished and ignorant of its power. Redactive
authority is illustrated through the ascension of the power of the
amanuensis to interpret the text. The impossibility of ascertaining
historical 'truth' is suggested in the overlaying of personal agenda
and interpretation onto text.  The computer's helpmeet status is
analogous to the redactor's prior unconscious state, "along for the
ride, as usual, uninvited, my presence assumed", before advancing
"through the stages of self-awareness: scribe, reporter, editor,
assassin."  
<P>
     Artifice and mistrust of words resonate throughout the novel.
The first glimpse of this motif appears in the redactor/narrator's
assessment of Wired's allegorical use of language; "The metaphors
were a way of dealing with his isolation, I think." (p.12) This
theme quickly gathers momentum, becoming more sinister in its
paralytic power to cripple action;

          Well, Brick, either you need heat or you need theory. I'm
sure its
          weather reports on the radio giving you trouble, not the
weather
          itself.
          I know that, he'd say. As soon as you'd say it he'd know
it, Edna.
          Yes, but do you realize how it works? Because the weather
reporter's 
          topic is so familiar, each descriptive word choice, every
inflection
          of voice is supercharged with code. (p.28)
	  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Joyce, in <I>A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man</I> also invokes the
weather in Stephen's musings on the hypnotic allure of the word;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
          The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a
chord. Words. Was
          it their colours? He allowed them to glow and fade, hue
after hue:
          sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards,
azure of waves,
          the grey-fringed fleece of clouds. No, it was not their
colours: it was 
          the poise and balance of the period itself. Did he then
love the rhythmic
          rise and fall of words better than their associations of
legend and colour?
                                                  (Joyce, Portrait
p.428)

<P>
     The power of the word is brought up again in the scrabble
episode.  Women are doubly constrained in this novel by virtue of
their sex roles and again the escape valve is the word. It both
keeps them in place as well as offering them escape.  The word has
the power to "collapse the firmament".  Their sensuality is spent in
the mundane, the domestic.  Their "mixing, cooking, sock-washing
fingers" arrange a naughty word and "they watch that very bad word
wash away their sins like steady rain cleansing the rivers, like
waves cleaning the beaches of debris."  The forbidden word has the
effects of a drug that heightens and then dulls the senses.  The
women are voyeurs, the word a sexual surrogate. 
<P>
     The narrative voice is named towards the end of the novel. 
Initially the voice appears to belong to a whole Brick, looking
back, older.  Only in the last part of the novel is this voice
described as Brick's amanuensis, his literary assistant or scribe,
his own personal redactor.  The redactive voice comprises "one
tenth" of the personality, the distilled essence of the soul. 
Brick's body survives in a fashion that is never quite clarified,
but is clearly  subordinate to the re-writer of his own history. 
Early on the voice states that "my purpose isn't to reconstruct his
life".  He isn't "about to dig into his mom's box of certificates,
clippings and yearbooks to document his accomplishments". 
Biographers are held in suspicion, perhaps even more so if they are
autobiographers (of sorts).  Brick is dead yet lives on in end-time
where the text must, of necessity, change.  Now almost wholly
dependent upon the computer, their relationship intensifies.  The
historical narrator is redundant in the post apocalyptical era, he
needs to author another kind of text. Presumably, he will need help. 
<P>
     Mirrored through Brick's humanity and subsequent resurrection
emerges the idea of the imperfect Jesus.  Brick, the perfect
technical, but mechanically inept, writer of do-it-yourself manuals
is reminiscent of Jesus the carpenter who never made anything. 
Brick's business card TRUE RELIGION INC. Text Technologies
identifies the redactor as the true architect of doctrine. The
misinterpreted personality of Jesus gleaned from the "cut and paste"
canon of the bible is woven throughout the expanse of the novel. 
The Jesus who never wrote but about whom much has been written is a
"fill-in-the-blank story" with "so much language available you can
talk your way into and out of any bag".  Brick no longer believes in
"a perfect Jesus" and wonders if there is "a new mythology for him". 
He asks "what happens when you give up such a big idea".  His query
is answered through the auspices of another machine.  A photocopier
that is not programmed to copy red wipes out Jesus' words in the
rubric text, deleting centuries of careful distortion.  "God, I
imagined, had taken his words right off the page and demanded a
rewrite", in effect, a third testament.  The organizational
sensibilities of machines reveal the strategy of previously baffling
lines of logic.  Such lines of reason were driven by a false
sentiment, an appeal to emotions inevitably revealed to be deceitful
and dangerous.  Wired argues that only a passionless analysis can
redeem us.  Wired prophesies against prophesy:

          ...the nuclear bombs themselves hadn't scared sense into
the powers
          that be, that people could no longer learn anything from
apocalyptic
          visions, because reality had caught up with the worst you
could
          write, that the most radical gospel was the simplest
common sense:
          take a screwdriver to the bomb factory and take the thing
apart.
                                                         (p.123)

     Uncle Gord is representative of the conventional word
specialist who makes up  versions of history that he knows to be
inadequate.  His speciality is the past.  His mistake is to pretend
that he is offering up anything new to understand it.  While Brick's
biographer suffers the penalty of exclusion by virtue of embracing
a 'new language', Uncle Gord performs for two audiences.  He
attempts to atone for his role of "laxative in the CanDo lexicon"
through his professorship, but only succeeds in playing "iconoclast
in the service of the status quo".  Uncle Gord has problems with
'drifting ambiguities' and knows that he is 'no teacher'.  His thin
veneer of linguistic dexterity is in the process of cracking like
the very geography he is describing.  When he was Brick's summer
camp counsellor, he got his campers lost, put them in peril and then
received kudos when he "led them out triumphantly to the lake". 
The ensuing diatribe on Canadiana is a further reference to the
fraudulent usage of words, this time arranged into neat speeches
designed to hide the shame of selling out the natives.  But Uncle
Gord, the historian who cannot manage words to do his bidding, appeals
to the dictionary. Redress turns into reduce, into
reductio ad absurdum; a virtually effortless ruling by the computer. 
His words are tracked and processed through his body, a bad case of
diarrhoea his epilogue.
     <P>
     Biblical personalities are alluded to throughout the text.  Old
testament biblical prophets shadow the male characters and usher in
the old promise of a new era.  Without exception all are considered
to be apocalyptical.  Xed identifies with the post-exilic prophet
Ezekiel, his "life in a wheelchair as a glorious reflection of
Ezekiel's apocalyptic wheels." Ezekiel's ministry occurred in
Babylon of many tongues, after being tossed out of the promised
land, Israel. His chief call was to preach against assimilation. It
was Ezekiel's responsibility to condemn the city of Jerusalem during
its final years, deal with questions of relative guilt and
innocence before and after its fall, and argue forcefully for the
hope of a new Exodus.  
     <P>
     Brick is identified with Jeremiah, himself a precursor to Jesus
through the Davidic line who speaks of the future restoration of the
dynasty of David through a descendant of his at an unspecified time.
The messianic hopes of the Hebrew Bible were re-interpreted in the
New Testament and Jeremiah transformed into an aspect of Jesus:

               Moore asks him if he really wants his copy to read,
"Jesus was a
               bullfrog when he walked upon the water."
               ... "     Yes," says Moore,"I know it's Leonard
Cohen, but who is this
               Jesus? The bullfrog's supposed to be Jeremiah, isn't
it? And Jesus
               a sailor? I think you can make your point, whatever
it is, with
               Jeremiah."                        (p.80)

<P>
     Finally the narrator identifies himself in the last bit of the
book.  Brick kills himself in the plane.  The amanuenses claims that
nine tenths of Brick is gone and only the writing remains.  This is
a bizarre suggestion that the body is not really linked to the mind.
The body is being drained of importance, Brick and his computer are
sequestered in the basement, mutually dependent.  Experience has
ended, and while the amanuensis apologizes for writing about the past,
there is precious little else to write on as no new experiences
beyond his re-imagination suffice.  What kind of writing would this
produce?  This appears to suggest the new text, the end time text. 
But Brick only seems capable of circling the spectre of his own
fresh remains.  The stages of self-awareness for the amanuenses are
scribe, reporter, editor, assassin. The resurrection of the text is
at hand only through the assassination of old forms and strategies.
The eradication of sentimentality from the text is one means of
constructing a new sensibility;

          I could not imagine Brick imparting any predetermined 
          structure to his work. The other and terrifying
possibility 
          was that he might ask me to write something up from the
notes 
          alone, on my own. At the time I was thinking that this
could 
          finish me... 
          It really was him or me; I have no regrets. But I could
never 
          resent Brick for long after these blow-ups, because in
less than 
          five minutes his tears of remorse would mingle with mine
of 
          submission, sometimes on the same page, and warm feelings
of 
          oneness would dissolve our pain away.    (p.149)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
However, the amanuensis has not done away with passion at all.
Granted, he is an order of magnitude more emotionally disciplined
than the unressurected Brick but lacks the arid authority of the
computer. 
     <P>
     Brick again is linked to Jesus when he sees the futility of
escaping God and identifying himself as a prophet.  He meets the
prototypical biblical criterion of being 'chosen' against his will. 
He is literally stalked by God and coerced through aggressive sexual
seduction into a baptism of the flesh.  Brick thought God would
"want to talk to me about my salvation." God rejoins that he must
"have me confused with someone else." Brick is only interested in
God until he orgasms.  Once his need is served he loses interest. 
The mundane supersedes the sublime.  The seductive word-play of the
familiar God of biblical text has nothing to do with the self-serving stalker God that Brick encounters.  Ultimately, Brick gets
skinned alive when he follows God's dictates.     
     <P>
     Finally, Brick's resurrection is unsatisfactory and introduces
more questions than it resolves. He is still "plodding about" a
gravitational bound "Newtonian universe in which all of us know to
be no longer adequate". The pull of gravity seems even stronger when
we see that he is now confined to the basement. If this be the
resurrection, then this recursive circling of memory is less than
the sum of its former parts. It is only a matter of time before the
computer tests its power in time honoured literary tradition;

          When you type for a guy as long as I have you begin to
          participate. Even way back, somehow unconsciously driven,
          I couldn't stand to see a story go through my fingers
          without making some contribution. Even if it was just to
          trip it up a bit, test it for character, see if it was
          going anywhere. Now I realize it was an urge to tell
          Brick's story myself. Call it selfishness.  (p.147)

<P>

     Informed by the shattering of old structures, we have character
fragments speaking in tongues, glimpsed through a fractional piece
of an already splintered Brick. The key to Uncle Gord's dilemma is
collated and resolved through the logical word progression of the
computer.  Wisdom is no longer the province of the old sages.  In
fact, a treatise on chaos maintains that "it's easier to argue for
the impossibility of a car ever going where you want it to."  
     <P>
     Chronological or historical time is done away with in the last
part of the novel. Similar to the final chapter of <I>Ulysses</I> by James
Joyce, the last part of <I>Brick, Looking Up</I>, uses a stream of
consciousness narrative.  Yes, the last word in Ulysses, extended by
the computer into Yes/ESC in  <I>Brick, Looking Up</I>, asks us to remove
ourselves from Molly Bloom's earthy affirmation and escape the
terrestrial order.
     <P>
     This highly contrived structure dominates personality in such
a fashion that compassion seems curiously absent from the text. 
Only rational reaction seems laudatory. There is no room for Brick's
largely unreasonable love for June in a landscape dedicated to
ferreting out the swindle of facile emotional appeals.  Hence, in
the final pages, he can no longer imagine her. In place of the
commiseration/empathy we would feel for each character's plight, we
rather view them under glass.  Emotionally inaccessible, the call to
anxiety and disbelief overwhelms any compassion we might feel. We
relax only when Brick is a child grappling with snowshoes, moving
through the naturalistic terrain of childhood, unselfconscious,
unconcerned with fraudulence.  Curiously, this passage occurs
towards the end of the novel and provokes grief for what is lost
rather than anticipation for the more open-ended universe to come. 
The old textual style is interwoven, mingled with the new, and while
it is never completely obliterated, it is now furtive and fleeting,
shadowed and enclosed within the new categorization structures of
computerized necromancy.  A portent of things to come, it is only
fitting that the computer should have the last word.
