I became the publisher of "It's a Bunny" when I had to fill out the form to
get an ISSN number.  There was a field called <I>Publisher</I> that needed
a name, and I stuck mine in there.  Until then, I was just the technocrat
amongst the literati responsible for design and informatics.
But now I'm a <I>publisher</I>.  Then again, on the Web, <I>everyone</I> 
is a <I>publisher</I>. But it's not every site that gets named <I><A

This issue represents yet another step forward in my efforts at designing an
aesthetic and intelligent Web magazine interface.  The basic elements from
<A HREF="../b01/bunny.html"> our first issue</A> have remained, real changes 
involve the addition of a virtual table of contents in the left column of 
the major sections, an upgrade in
style, and you can instantly return to the top page just by clicking the
stylized 'b' in the top left corner.  These changes should make the magazine 
load faster, make navigation easier, and still provide a unique environment 
in which to enjoy some fine creative works. It's spring. Enjoy.<BR>
