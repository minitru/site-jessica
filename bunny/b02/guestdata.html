<BR><BR>Just a few comments re: Michael Ruddihy's poetry:  Rider is a wonderful, ecstatic love poem.  The first stanza had me outta the chair, clapping wildly.  A few soft spots in some of the other poems; the second last stanza in the poem previous to Rider was, I thought, completely expendable.  (Should I be hitting return here?  I'm a sloppy ignoramus who has never left a message in a guestbook before; forgive me.)  Anyway, a fine e-zine (almost 3000 visitors! good on ya!)  Keep me posted.  I'll be sending something shortly.  Or longly.  Etc.

<BR><BR>I never thought I'd find a place where my bunny talk 
made sense to anyone else but me and my husband.  We
have several bunny visitors in our home.  Carl, the elder
bunny who like gin and tonics and Patsy from Abfab, then
theres Frederick who came over from Amsterdam and 
loves sausage and his woman Francesca, who sleeps all
day and night, but will get up for cake and wine.  Our 
smaller bunnies, Johann and Josephine are from Bavaria.
We need to watch Johann in traffic, hes nuts, and Josephine
has a fetish with Zima.  Her ears are wild like lightning
bolts!  These guys are cool.  We always have a 
party in our home.  Bunnies are god.

<BR><BR>Good work!  Only one item did not work for me: listening
to the 381k .au poetry file in this Spring issue.
For some reason the sound came out disorted, "red-shifted", as
if slowed down nearly to a stop.  Now, I have an antiquated Mac IIcx
and Netscape 2.02 and Mozilla plug-in (for .au) -- I don't use Mozilla much
	Has anyone else reported trouble?

Oh, and thanks for reciprocal URLs to ASGP and Agnieszka's Dowry.  Good luck!

<BR><BR>Looking good, Jessica! What pound weight are you using for the new issue? I like the layout. Don't have regular access to the Internet, and not in an environment to actually read the 'zine, but like what I see. Kinda skimpy on the "contributers" note, huh? I remain an enigma. I'm looking for work, rewriting a Rabbit and Baby Judy novella Howling at the Moon, and dreaming of the day I've finished the Rabbit and baby Judy manuscript. If anybody asks. So you're going monthly in the fall, huh? congratulations. maybe i'll have something for you by then... . Say hey to Montreal for me. Shout out to Golda and Lydia.
