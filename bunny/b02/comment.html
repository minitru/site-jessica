I became the publisher of "It's a Bunny" when I had to fill out the form to
get an ISSN number.  There was a field called <I>Publisher</I> that needed
a name, so I filled in the blank.  Until then, I was just the technocrat
amongst the literati responsible for design and informatics.
But now I'm a <I>publisher</I>.  Then again, on the Web, <I>everyone</I> 
is a <I>publisher</I>. But it's not every site that gets named a <I><A

In my ongoing search for the ultimate magazine interface, our little oasis 
in Cyberia now boasts a virtual table of contents along the left
side of major sections, improved graphics, and a stylized 'b' in the upper
left hand corner that instantly sends you back to the front page.  A
fitting environment for some of the remarkable works in this issue.
It's finally spring, enjoy.

Finally, our Spring issue is ready for release. 
<P>
For the time being we are a quarterly publication but we have lofty
ambitions.  We plan to come out monthly beginning in October.  We will also
do our best to respond to submissions within two weeks, if at all possible.
The launch (I am told) was a success.  Yes, I was there, but waited for
gossip to circulate just to be sure.
<P>
We are in need of short fiction, sudden or postcard fiction, and essays not
too self-consciously literary.  Please comment.  We love the feedback.  And
thanks for all the support.
