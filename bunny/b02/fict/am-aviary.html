Two weeks ago, a bald eagle perched on a bare branch of the elm
at the edge of our property, its back to the house, facing
Findlay's barley field.  Luna, my wife, had seen it first and
called me up from the cellar.
<P>
     "Martin!" she'd shouted, "There's an eagle the size of a
Volkswagen out here!"  Then, "Omigod, the cat!  Martin!"
<P>
     I'd climbed the cellar stairs and stepped outside to look. 
The sun was shortly to begin its way down, ponderous and swollen
out above the horizon.  The hour seemed late for eagles (though
this was only a guess: what do I know of eagles?).  Still, there
was the cat, shrinking towards the house, having just seen one of
the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  And there was the eagle,
surveying the barley  field--until the eagle's appearance,
sovereign territory of the cat.
<P>
     I made the rescue without circumstance, the cat happy to see
me for once.  All the while I had kept an eye on the large bird,
who hadn't really been interested much, having earlier feasted on
one of Findlay's sheep, most likely.  It was a big and terrible
creature, like a god swooped down to earth.  Luna was upset,
spluttering on about shooting it out of the tree, damn predatory
fucker (the bird, that is), vainglorious totem of rotten,
stinking America, why'd it choose our damn island, our damn farm. 
I must have looked alarmed at this talk of hers.  If vampires
were declared an endangered species, she demanded as she grabbed
the cat, would that stop me from pounding a stake through one's
heart?  My experience of vampires, I said, like my experience of
bald eagles, was too slight to choose a course of action on pure,
indiscriminate impulse.  She looked at me like I was mad.
<P>
     "Who the hell are you?" she said.  "Mr. Spock?"
     <P>
     Normally, Luna and I are pretty cozy.  But the past couple
months have seen a growing number of disputes, a chilling of the
marriage bed.  On occasion, one of us will sleep sulkily in the
guest room or on the living room couch, defying all descents into
the blubbering of pet names and general repentance until morning,
when we are too tired to fight, when we remember that we love
each other.  I come down in the mornings to Luna's bare feet
hanging over the arm of the sofa where she lies, her red hair
piled over an oblivious dozing face.  I might suck her small toes
to wake her and we might make sleepy apologetic love.  Or not. 
It might be instead that I wake from a dream, in which I've
contracted a new mutant tuberculosis, to the cat--a Russian Blue
named Rudy--hunkered on my chest and staring me to consciousness
with eyes the size of cantaloupes.  Feed me.  Let me out.  Clean
my box.  This kind of thing, the demands this animal has, makes
children hard to imagine.
<P>
     So when the eagle took off, my heart momentarily swelled
with inadequacies, the freedom of eagles, God's tremendous beasts
of the air, unfettered by terrestrial etc.  The wing-span
stretched to seven feet if an inch and its scaly talons would
surely have sliced through the beloved cat had they got a hold of
his royal highness's earthly husk.  I wasn't the only one who'd
hate to have had a thing like that ripping at my liver.  There
was a quiver of cow flesh from Findlay's back pasture when the
eagle flapped by.  Or so you might imagine.
     <P>
     "Quite a sight," I'd said to Luna.  The bird beat its wings
against a sky like a bloodied peach.
     <P>
     Luna spooned some cat food from a tin.  "What's to see?" she
said.
     <P>
     There was a moment I got it in my mind to leave her.  Her
vision not reconciled with my own, her dreams contrary to mine,
her lack of sympathy for eagles at cross purposes with my own. 
(My hatred of the cat.)
     <P>
     And in ambivalence, I imagined my departure.
     <P> 
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>
     What do you take with you when abandoning a wife?  Should
you have a destination, or should you simply pull out onto the
highway in your Datsun half-tonne and stalk the tangle of roads
to sanctuary?  Should you leave in the middle of the night with
Luna holding onto her pillow for dear life as she sleeps, or in
the morning, with a picnic lunch in the passenger seat, and Luna
hurling insults and wedding gifts at you as your truck wobbles
down the driveway?  What will you do when your heart breaks--and
it will--at the sight of her grief, her rage, her indifference,
her laughter, whatever it may be?  And when you reach sanctuary,
if you reach it, and wonder "From what?", what then?  What, you
might ask, do you really care about eagles?
     <P>
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>

     Originally, Luna had been a tourist.  She had come shopping
at the home of a potter friend of mine and arts collaborator,
Perry Callaghan, who ran our crafts business from his farm.  Some
people considered Perry a little strange, an elfish leftover from
a hippie era that had barely happened on the island, though they
loved his pots, often decorated with echoes of a storybook world. 
He'd shown Luna how to throw a pot with his old kick wheel, the
wet cylindrical vessel rising up from the fundamental lump of
clay, merrily holding forth on the creationist connotations of
this.  Afterwards, I'd shown her the large dragon Perry and I had
made and planted out on his back lawn, my metalwork frame,
Perry's glazed ceramic scales, eyes, tongue.  There were more
abstract pieces of my own hanging on the outside walls of the
barn (car-wrecks, Ma Callaghan had called them), big Kandinsky-like loops, slabs, and strips of multi-coloured steel and tin
against the weather-worn grey wood.  Beautiful, Luna said.  And
not the usual tourist fare (meaning, I presumed, the many
incarnations of the freckle-faced Island heroine as coffee cup,
marionette, tea cozy).  She bought an Italian wine jug of Perry's
and three small bird shapes I'd forged in iron, turned down our
offer of a drink and climbed back into her car.  Perry and I had
returned to the workshop thinking little more of her.
     <P>
     She came again the next year, supposedly to buy one of the
abstracts.  They had haunted her all the way back home, she'd
said mischievously.  And afterwards she'd asked me out to dinner
(These city women! Perry had cried with glee).  We'd feasted on
mussels and lobster at a wharfside restaurant and made love on
the beach, fighting the night's chill of Atlantic winds on our
backs.  I'd run naked into the frigid ocean and come up plastered
with seaweed like a drowned man returned from the dead.  "I love
this place," she'd said.  "I don't think I want to leave."  We
were married within three months, the service held in Perry's
backyard among the sculptures of dragons and giant fairy-tale
frogs and car-wrecks.
     <P>
     Two years ago.
<P>
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>

     First thing I did after the eagle incident was go to
Perry's.  This was a precautionary move.  If upon leaving my wife
I'd found myself rolling into some godforsaken burg halfway
across the country, suddenly figuring out it was all a horrible
mistake--my own ill-conceived equivalent of a hairweave or
nineteen year-old  inamorata--I'd have some time explaining
myself to Luna.  I'd seen Perry's own marriage disintegrate
helplessly over mistakes like this.  And like Perry said, the
problem could be me or my wife, or any number of things.  It
could be the foggy cerebral aftermath of a few too many paint
fumes.   It could be a mischief-waging tumour.  Anything at all. 
A seismic ripple borne along from darkest childhood might
eventually fuck anybody up, he reminded me.  With a trial run at
his place, I could camouflage everything in the last fight Luna
and I had played out (flying dishware, scurrying cat).  Pretend
to have been drunk for three days, say, seeking commiseration
from my hippie friend before sobering up enough to skulk home.
     <P>
     I sat at Perry's kitchen table, sipping the hot cider he'd
placed in front of me and thought of Luna.  When we'd married,
she had given up a good job in the big city to teach at a
mediocre community college, to live with me on an Island whose
community some said was rapidly and uniformly dwindling to the
aged and those too dumb to leave.  We had moved her things twelve
hundred miles.  That two years later it might all have been for
naught was not really thinkable.
     <P>
     There had been some adjustments, the city yielding to the
country in her.  It had taken her a year to reckon with the rural
night, the absolute darkness, the possibility of animals.  Even
now, it seemed nothing short of a chimney fire would send her
outside after dusk.  She still switched on all the hall
nightlights before consigning herself to a bedroom in which she
felt weightless when the bedside lamp went out, as if visibility
bestowed mass.  Shopping was initially akin to prospecting for
gold as far as she was concerned, until the proper stores were
eventually found.  Television was virtually non-existent ("We
don't have cable out here," Perry told her, "we only got TFC." 
"What's that?" Luna asked hopefully.  "Two fuckin' channels," he
crowed.)  And she had great difficulty with the church groups and
petty puritanisms of some of the farm women, the "Repent!" and
"Prepare to Meet Thy God!" signs along the small highways, the
<I>patriarchy</I> of it all, she said, though soon found the
Island boasted numerous feminist organizations, a lesbian
publishing company, and would elect a woman to the top Island
post six months after our wedding.
     <P>
     Naturally, there were delights as well, the food as fresh as
can be (hot from the dirt, said Perry), the magnificent and
unending silence, the landscape and beaches and ocean.  The
church ladies and farmers' wives were more often than not decent,
shockingly strong women underneath their straitlaced exteriors. 
Luna had been quite happy until recently.  Now I was screwing it
all up.
</B></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=85%><TR><TD><B>
     <P>
     And naturally, at a distance from her as I now was--if only
a distance of ten  miles--I began missing her immediately.  The
smallness of her, the warmth and strength of skin.  She bore my
rag and bone shop scavengery with great humour.  She made love
with an almost frightening earnestness.  She even made more money
than me.  She was the one who had sacrificed.  I had sacrificed
nothing.
     <P>
     "What would you do, Perry?"
     <P>
     "I'd count myself lucky."
     <P>
     "I am lucky."
     <P>
     "One lucky sonofabitch."
     <P>
     "Lately I've been feeling less lucky, more like moving to
the Yukon.  At times, anyway."
     <P>
     "Bears in the Yukon.  Bears and madmen."
     <P>
     "I'd buy a gun."
     <P>
     "You, with a gun."
     <P>
     "Maybe I should go on a short trip.  Clear my mind."
     <P>
     "Walkabout, like."
     <P>
     "In the Datsun."
     <P>
     "Mm-hm."
     <P>
     "You'd keep an eye on Luna for me?  Make sure everything's
all right?"
     <P>
     "You think Luna would still be here?"
     <P>
     "Would you go, Perry?"
     <P>
     "Nope.  I would not."
     <P>
     "What <I>would</I> you do?"
     <P>
     "Throw pots.  Reflect at the wheel."
     <P>
     Which is when I started to build the aviary.
     <P>
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>
     Mallet flying, Luna was pounding the chicken breasts flat
for the paillards with orange sauce.  She had renewed an interest
in cooking since leaving the city, and I was the happy recipient
of an endless variety of culinary experiments.  I sat at the
kitchen table, sipping her homemade blueberry wine, watching the
cat prowl the yard for field mice.  He killed about one a day.  A
few weeks back he appeared on the deck with a dead partridge
overwhelming his little mouth.  Luna had had a fit.  I had
explained to her what I saw as the stupidity of local partridges,
their seeming resentment of flight--toddling along in front of
the half-tonne as I drove down the driveway, running from the
cat, who was only too happy to try teaching them a lesson. 
Stupidity, Luna said, was no excuse for showing up dead on her
deck.  I cheered secretly for the cat that time.  
     <P>
     While Luna mixed the marinade, she broached the subject of
what she called my disenchantment.  Did I not love her?  Was
there some slut on the side?  Had I succumbed to the selfish
immature rutting that was the wont of shitheads like me the world
round?  Other like-minded rhetoric.  Soon she was crying, the
tears mingling with the orange juice concentrate and brandy.  I
reached my hand out from the kitchen table to open air, Luna with
her back to me, her shoulders giving tiny uncontrollable heaves,
the kitchen alive with the mint leaves she tore into bits and let
flutter into the sauce.
     <P>
     "Maybe I've lost my mind," I thought out loud.
     <P>
     "Maybe?" Luna cried as if there were not a doubt.
     <P>
     "Perry suggested I take it out on my work."
     <P>
     "<I>Screw</I> Perry!"
     <P>
     I tried to explain.  "I'm building an aviary."
     <P>
     Spinning around, she took the glass casserole and flung it
to the floor, brandy and orange juice everywhere.  I stood up,
saying, "Luna," and she turned away again.  
     <P>
     The truth is that after talking to Perry for a day I had
started to believe it wasn't actually the marriage.  I loved
Luna.  It seemed there was some more fundamental ruckus of the
soul going on.  As soon as the aviary entered my mind, I knew it
had to be built, as if the project were a congenital looniness to
be followed through at all costs.  Everything that had slowly
ushered in this little epiphany, the fighting and longings and
conflicts of cosmology Luna and I were having, all these were
mere symptoms.  The real ailment had now erupted to the surface,
inexplicable a thing as it may have been.
     <P>
     "A what?" Luna exclaimed.
     <P>
     "An aviary," I said.
     <P>
     "An aviary."
     <P>
     "Yes."
     <P>
     "Why?"  She had turned to me now.
     <P>
     "Don't know, exactly.  Feel it in my gut."
     <P>
     "The eagle," she said, a glimmer of understanding.
     <P>
     "The eagle," I said.
     <P>
     "You can't <I>cage</I> that thing."
     <P>
     "I'm not going to.  I'm building an aviary."
     <P>
     She stared at me, the tears gone.  "You need help."
     <P>
     She said that with such love I couldn't be sure how she
meant it.
     <P>

     At night, alone in a jumble of quilts and blankets (Luna
slumbering in self-imposed exile downstairs) with the high winds
singing against the bedroom window, I fret about the aviary. 
I've fallen victim to compulsion, of that there seems little
doubt.  Perry calls it a transitional creative episode.  Luna
still suspects a marital crisis, and if it is not, it is
provoking one.  She becomes more irritable by the day, goes
around the house breaking things, perhaps in answer to my own
creative inclinations.  Meanwhile at night I dream of birds being
beaten against the window by bursting gales as if by a sadistic
child, their clicking beaks pressed to the glass, their pebbly
terrified eyes imploring rescue.  Of the blankets fluttering
around me with the palpitations of wings from birds I find
littering the bed like vermin.  One morning I wake up downstairs,
on the floor propped up at the foot of Luna's bed in the spare
room, cowled in a woolen blanket stripped from her array of
bedthings.  I leave before she sees me there.
     <P>
     She finds me in the living room, entranced by Allegri's
<i>Miserere</I>.  After making coffee, she demands to know the
purport of the aviary.
     <P>
     "What does it <i>mean</I>?"
     <P>
     "Mean?" I ask.
     <P>
     "What's the <I>object</I> of it?"
     <P>
     "Object?"
     <P>
     "What will the thing <I>say</I> to people?"
     <P>
     It hadn't really occurred to me that people would require it
say something.  I hadn't actually imagined it as public.  But of
course it will be.  A big crazy birdhouse in our backyard would
bring a phalanx of observers, lined up for confrontation,
demanding as Luna does now an explanation.  This is what I tell
her.
     <P>
     The aviary is to be thirty feet long, fifteen feet wide,
twenty feet high.  It will not be used to cage eagles, or other
birds of prey for that matter.  Materials will include
fencepoles, copper plumbing pipe and chain link firstly, as well
as old bed frames, ductwork, abandoned farm equipment, chunks of
automobile, twists of aluminum siding.  Also I will work
extensively in wood for the first time, as the nature of birds
requires this, and have enlisted Perry to help haul the remains
of several large trees to the workshop, where I will smooth and
carve and embellish them, to stand them in the aviary as perches. 
Other living trees will be enclosed upon erection (saplings, too,
may be necessary in the end, and will ensure the aviary has the
potential for growth and change).  After rustproofing, the whole
enclosure will be painted with bright and rich colours: poppy,
marigold, parrot, lapis lazuli, mulberry, canary yellow. 
Birdbaths and reservoirs will be set out, as well as an
assortment of water droppers, feeders, seed trays.  The whole
will be catproofed (an eye here to his majesty), the chain link
requiring entrance from on high.  I haven't thought much farther
than this, I tell her.  Meanings have always been slippery things
to me, grant applications and such forbidding.
     <P>
     "You won't tell me," she says and launches into marriage as
imprisonment metaphors, the outward cage signifying the inward
claustrophobia, and so on, to explain away the aviary.  The idea
had occurred to me, too, but rings hollow, too simple, too easy.
</B></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=85%><TR><TD><B>
     <P>
     I don't really have an explanation for her.
     <P>
     "Sometimes," I say, quoting Perry quoting Freud, "a cigar is
just a cigar."
     <P>
     Luna stares in disbelief.  The treble lines of the Allegri
soar almost beyond the music itself to a transcendent high C.
     <P>
     "Listen," I say.  "Castrati might have sung those notes
hundreds of years ago.  People do all sorts of things in the name
of art.  Am I being that terrible?"
     <P>
     She screams and leaves the room.

     <P>
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>
     As it turns out, she leaves the farm, too.  She's taken
refuge at our neighbour Findlay's place, Ma Findlay relaying the
information that Luna doesn't feel like talking to me, looking at
me, listening to me.  And who can blame her? says the old farm
lady, with a goddamned fool husband like me ruining her life.  I
suppose I've had that coming.  Still, after her daily and
forthright rulings on the matter, Ma Findlay is partly sympathetic 
in her old-time way, bringing me biscuits and rhubarb
relish, and checking up on me in the secret hope, I suspect, that
she'll find my near-dead body in the pick-up parked in a sealed
garage, surrounded by the viatica of self-inflicted death (sad
notes, drained mickeys, pill packets).  There's not much
excitement on these farms and who can blame the inhabitants for
savouring a little gossip and scandal, for dreaming they'll
stumble upon some misguided wretch just in the nick of time, call
the doctor, be the hero.  Each time Ma Findlay pops her silvery
head in the door and finds me alive, or steps into the workshop
to see I haven't cut myself in half with the table saw, her heart
might sink a little.  I hate to disappoint her.  So I tell her
how I miss Luna terribly, how all I want is for her to come back. 
It's the truth, and it pleases Ma Findlay to no end.  "She'll
come back when she's good and ready," she says, "if you're
lucky," and shoves another basket of biscuits my way.
     <P>
     Perry says he doesn't want to be an alarmist, but you never
know with women, he says.  They can get an idea in their heads,
and that's it, they're like a pit bull on a baby.  No getting
them off it till they're done.  By the time Luna's done at
Findlay's it may be too late, he says.  Deep down, I don't
believe that, and I don't think Perry does either.  I still take
time off from the aviary to make a peace offering, a gift, and
Perry helps, too.  It's Rudy the cat, of course, done up in black
metal and grey ceramic, all looping tail and Egyptian eyes, not
something I would have chosen to do.  Luna's had to leave the
real Rudy with me, on account of Findlay's dog, Jake, who can't
abide cats (and who can blame you, dear, toothy Jake?).  Perry
serves as the messenger, getting word of the sculpture to Luna,
since I can't say I trust Ma Findlay to do it right.  I've
planted the sculpture on the lawn, as we've done with others, as
Perry has done with his dragons and things.  The metal and
ceramic Rudy is visible from the road, set at the front of the
house like a giant sentinel mouse-killer.  Every once in a while,
I peek out a front window to see if Luna has wandered over, if
she is driving by, to catch a glimpse of the offering.  But if
she has done so, I've missed it.  A week goes by without a
glimpse.  That Perry could be right, that it could be too late--it crosses my mind each time I take a moment to peek up the road,
and see nothing but the potato fields and an empty strip of grey
asphalt, the cat, the metal one, looking out there, too, and
waiting.  
     <P>
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>
     
     I've made a lot of things over the years.  Perry and I earn
our money from the menagerie of doodads, pots and metalworks we
make for the tourists, passersby, and exporters (who hawk our
wares in craft shops across the country).  Perry has his
creatures, the odd fairy tale creations that inhabit his yard. 
He has a path made of glazed stones going nowhere, just a lash of
colour embedded in the lawn, avenue to some other world.  There's
a gingerbread house made for his daughter who visits each summer,
the building complete with concealed winking witch, a work that
has nothing to do with his divorce, he'll tell you.  I've got my
barnhangings, my cubistic windmill, my Klee-like metal eruptions
smiling at the neighbours who drive by my own farm.  The house
and outbuildings are overgrown with scrapshapes, ironworks,
curios, stuff.  We're not always sure why we make these things. 
There's an aspect of being born to it.  Not why we make them;
more, could we not make them.  But the aviary is something
altogether new.  I know it, Perry knows it, Luna knows it.

     <P>
     <HR WIDTH=65%> <P>
     Perry comes to watch and help.  He sits on a tractor seat
I've converted to a chair, his back against the workshop wall,
his clay-spattered boots propped on an overturned rain-barrel. 
He sips on a glass of raspberry cordial cut with mineral water,
and between bites of a sandwich asks me questions, such as, "What
about lightning?"
     <P>
     "What about lightning?" I repeat.
     <P>
     "All this metal rising up, twenty feet high," says Perry. 
"like a lightning rod."
     <P>
     "You think so?" I say.  For the first time my resolve to
build the aviary is given a disturbing nudge as the world of
weather impinges on the world of art.
     <P>
     "Be a question for an engineer or architect, I guess," Perry
replies.  "Don't know enough myself.  Mysterious thing, though. 
They talk about it having a finger in the creation of life on
earth, you know.  The formation of the right organic chemicals,
amino acids and such.  Understand lightning, and you might
understand creation."
     <P>
     "Big thoughts."
     <P>
     "Big subject, science."
     <P>
     "You figure I'm into a mad scientist thing?"
     <P>
     "Could be you're just building a birdhouse."
     <P>
     And so on, through the welding and cutting and fitting and
forging of the aviary.
     <P>
     "Magritte," says Perry, "would put eggs not birds in the
cage."
     <P>
     "I am not Magritte."
     <P>
     "No, you're not.  Roast chickens, maybe."
     <P>
     "No."
     <P>
     "Small delinquent children."
     <P>
     All of a sudden Luna is standing in the doorway, three cold
lagers in hand, prettier than a roaring fire to a frostbit dog. 
It's been three weeks since I've I seen her, since the castrati
incident and her angry flight from home.  I nearly cut my thumb
off for joy.
     <P>
     "If I had my way," she says, "I'd put you both in the damn
cage and swallow the key."
     <P>
     I'm afraid to move.  Perry speaks.
     <P>
     "Following his bliss, like," he explains of me with a grin.
     <P>
     Luna pops open one of the beers, hands it to Perry.  
     <P>
     "My ass," she says, but smiles nonetheless.  She comes over
to me, runs a hand up the back of my neck into my hair.  "He's
nuts.  I'll find an ear under my pillow next."
     <P>
     "Or a wing," Perry says.
     <P>
     They both laugh.
     <P>
     But the aviary feels right.  I am sticking to my guns.

     "The crane is here," Luna says from the top of the cellar
stairs.  For a brief moment I think she is speaking of an animal,
a great grey bird tall as a six-year old child, on a fence stump
out back, or performing its strange courtship dance in our yard
while I emerge from the cellar, the lunatic St. Francis of Assisi
come offering friendship, Dr. Doolittling my way across the lawn. 
But of course it is the machine Luna means, here to put the roof
on the aviary.
     <P>
     "Almost done," she says as I meet her on the stairs.  Her
tone suggests some kind of test.  That is not far off the mark, I
decide.
     <P>
     "Almost," I say squeezing her shoulder.  
     <P>
     "I want you back," she says.  "You got me back.  I want
you."  Looking into her eyes, I see the traumata of recent
months, the fragility of the marriage hovering in the worried
blue, my own wife infirm with fear and I have a hard time
acknowledging my responsibility for this.  Mad scientist's wife
syndrome is what she has.  If she asked right now, I would
abandon the project instantly, near completion as it is.
     <P>
     "It's not you, Luna," I say, and try to impart some faith in
this with the pressure of my hands on her small arms.  Then I go
out to meet the crane, Perry attendant beside the machine, the
sun high and showering the fields with golden light, the two
workmen like two gruff and absurd altar boys awaiting our
ministrations.
     <P>
     "Bring 'er round back," I decree.

     The completed aviary has numerous admirers already, though
few of them to this point are actual birds, even if, as Luna
observes, a number of the farm women who come to see it--in
contrast to their round and buttery sisters--are bird-like. 
Still, there have been some avian visitors, some finches,
sparrows, blackbirds, and there will be more, once word gets
around.  It pleases me to see it standing there, it pleases Luna,
now that it is finished (it distresses the cat--a final,
unintended reward).  Luna's tiny hand takes mine as we scrutinize
it from the hummock of lawn behind the house.

     "I like it," she says, her eye, perhaps, on the two bluejays
nibbling from a hanging feeder.
     <P>
     "Me too," I say, and we return to the house.
     <P>
     Luna has prepared a dinner, a kind of celebratory meal, a
gift for my finishing the aviary, and we've invited Perry, of
course, since he's had a hand in it all.
     <P>
     Perry brings his own gift.  It's a relief in clay, sand, and
robin's bone of Icarus plunging from the sky.  Indifferent
farmers go dumbly about their work in the foreground, a scenario
lifted from Breughel.  Even Luna laughs.  Perry points out that
according to myth, Daedalus also dreamed up the potter's wheel. 
The coincidence of it all, he exclaims, was too strong to resist. 
The interference of art with life impossible to ignore.
     <P>
     And I thought I was building a sanctuary, a spa for the
feathered tribes.  I haven't become reckless with the
exhilaration of flight.  That's not what I've been up to.
     <P>
     In Breughel's painting, Icarus is rendered at the point of
impact, his bare bloodless legs momentarily above water, his
crippled body already drowning.  He is a dribble of paint and
myth in a vast rustic landscape.
