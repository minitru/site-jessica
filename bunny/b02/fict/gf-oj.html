splash and glass of orange juice on my face and clothes.  I'm
drowning in sun again.  little girls tossed on a field.  try to
look statue.  oops sorry, Geal said, making those laughing sounds. 
it was always the same eee ee sounds they made whenever I walked
near their circles.
<P>
when we played duck duck goose they stepped on my hands.
<P>
at sunset we had to go to bed.  I got the bunkbed by the door where
the mosquitoes joined in the game to suck my blood.  in the
morning, sometimes I'd awake my eyelids puffed up and I'd see them
look confirmed that I was a mutant.  my hands working anyway would
reach out spidering bare shelf, no ray-ban sunglasses like all the
other girls had.
<P>
that was only the first summer.
<P>
when it came round to June, there was no discussion --
the sunshine and swimming and the canoeing were the best thing any
girl could ask for.  now finish your orange juice.
<P>
throughout the years, and there were seven, I was soaked with the
image of endless fields and how I had to walk through them alone
and how sometimes I had to fall down after only a few steps and sob
it out.  it circles into dreams even now.
<P>
<I>
     I've got a high view of the green fields and it's centuries
ago.  I'm wearing a white diaphanous dress that someone made me
wear and it's got its own arms moving.  The windowpane is round and
is my only view of green everywhere. it's coming out of the earth
and is my only cool.  I know it will not last.  I can hear the
heavy footsteps on the staircase so very down below.
</I>
<P>
     My mom would come in and wake me up for school by throwing
iron-pressed outfits on my face, then complain that I wasn't
getting up. 
<P>
     My dad, he'd slip in later when I was already sun-drenched
with exhaustion and he'd fumble with the open curtains a bit
saying, All the world s a stage and you have to dress for the part. 
<P>
     So when my dad asked me, what about this Wane character?  Is
he another one of your yahoos?  I told myself, Now I've managed not
to go back to camp since I was fourteen, but think, a summer that
doesn't start with summer school or slave jobs either, as I mouthed
the words responsible and loving.
<P>
     Wane and I were driving down the highway behind our shades. 
the day I told him everything, Wane's eyes were ice cubes trying
not melt.  He said, We're going to do it anyway and he went out and
got a van with a tear-drop window and a tool box.
<P>
     Wane hadn't slept in nights and was practically keeling over
the wheel.  Look what you have done to me.
<P>
     My parents' Happy June kisses farther and farther away.
<P>
     Trace had given us coffee and cigarette kisses.  Coffee kisses
to Wane and cigarette kisses to me.  Her old words felt like
shingles now.  She used to tell us, Think of words in terms of
being like small treasures like clams and to take words like a
word, like just all words, the colour of words, the sounds of
words, and how they look on the page, and how they feel in your
mouth.  It had wind, those chilling nights when we all talked
around writing and it sounded like the thing itself was something
we couldn't touch but made me write for hours after.  
     <P>
     Now I see Wane sitting in all Trace's sofas instead of filling
those spaces and his fingerprints blur everything.  And then I see
Trace eyeing me and I think, Someone please tell her that she
smashed our moon cup along with the others and her only phone.
     <P>
     Smashing, she was faltering with her cigarette wand, and it
was one of those helpless times where you didn't know what was
wrong until she choked up, Ashtray and Wane was right there with
one under her hand, Smashing.  Then she looked straight at me and
said, The best kind of bars on the road will have an ashtray by the
pay-phone and think of me then.
<P>

     Whenever we pulled up to truckstops I asked for sardine
sandwiches.  This gave Wane a chance to tell me I was disgusting.

<P>
     -- I'm fish and you're meat.  Leave a message and make it
sweet.
     <P>
     -- It's Wane, found on moonshine since you haven't been
returning my calls, where the FUCK are you???

<P>
     Let's go over it again.  Let's go over it again, Wane reached
above and tilted the overhanging light in my face.
     <P>
     I started out slow and told him, Everyday at lunch you walked
me to your house and you sucked the thick milkshake up with your
straw never taking your eyes off of me.
     <P>
     No tell me more.  I really want to understand this.
     <P>
     You're not going to remember how I kept golden waffles stocked
in your freezer because that was your favourite.  My eyes on his
cold kitchen tiles saying this.
     <P>
     Yes I am going to remember that's why I want to know
everything.
<P>
<I>
     There's a tower and at noon when the sun is directly overhead
you bring me way up on its flat roof and tell me to open the very
big book and let you see all the ink marks on the new page and all
their curves.  The wind helps me, it makes things difficult.  The
handwriting's spidery anyway, I murmured, but you insist.  The ink
marks are throbbing off the page.
</I>
<P>
     The sun was still hurting even with the shades.  But at least
Wane couldn't see my eyes.  My Salada eyes.  The way he called them
that.  The way he showed me around the kitchen and consumed all
liquids.  My Salada eyes.  He wanted to milk them and leave them
white.  My eyes widening on their way.
<P>
<I>  
     He closed the very big book with a bang and cast his finger
upon me.  Do you realize that you could be burned at the stake for
having red hair alone in my kingdom.  You must relay to me your
soul.  It is the only way.
</I>
<P>
     There is a place where Wane promised that good friendship is
a straight yellow brick road to a successful relationship.  It is
Wane's kitchen.  Me, right on his kitchen table.  Him holding me up
by the knees.  Before I can answer he is sucking back my breath but
when it comes around again, I say okay, I believe in giving things
a whirl.  The sun coming through in slits.
     <P>
     He said, you won't regret it.  I want to give you everything
you want.  I ll give you a van.  I'll give you the sun.  He led me
up the curved staircase.
<P>

by the first minute, all the girls had rolled out the red-carpeted
plans on which guy was whose and how they were going to get them. 
who was available? take your pick, the guys're all wearing concert
T-shirts with SOLD OUT stamped on the back in red ink, such choice. 
Geal said it didn't matter anyway because she had already been felt
up by the movie star Corey Haim before he was famous in their
school, Zion Heights.  I'd watch them put their fresh layers of
make-up on, their only protection from the sun.  it only reminded
me of how I used sunscreen and still was the one with the pale skin
who got burnt.  I waited like a diaphanous sheet for them to finish
primping.  I got, do you have staring problems? a lot.  I tried to
keep my eyes on the ground.
<P>
when they rolled their plans back up it was final.
<P>

     I m thirsty again, Wane said, pulling up to another truckstop. 
My feet landed outside the van with the wind picking up any loose
objects on the ground.  Wane was ahead trying to open the glass
door, ringing bells.  He was having a hard time, kicking away at
the swirling hamburger Styrofoam containers that were going for his
legs like Pac-Man.  He tried to retaliate by making his curses
strong enough to take chunks out of the sidewalk.
<P>
     Wane was poking around with a paper cup filled with sticky
orange juice.  Each pulp freshly squeezed.  The thought of it
burned my empty stomach.
     <P>
     He leaned over and asked me if I wanted anything, his lips
crawling on my cheek, his teeth grazing.
     <P>
     Maybe I should fucking go back.  
     <P>
     You can't fucking back out of this.  He rolled back his
tongue.
     <P>
     Then he was buying maps again, cramming them into his clothes,
practically tattooing himself with highways.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     Wane insisted on driving but was lost on sunset.
     Wane: How do you get back on the highway?
     me: I think it was back there, we needed to make a left.
     Wane: No it's straight ahead.
     ----- more yellow road pills gobbled later ---
     gas station attendant: You had to make a left way back there.
     repeat 1x a day when the sun goes down
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
when I got back to my bunkbed my stomach was a blender on Ginsu but
up against the glass window I'd still get this feeling of
suspension.  I'd be afraid to move.  maybe I'd fall asleep and fall
off the bed.  sometimes I'd think maybe they can't touch me up
here, but then they'd start throwing darts. 
<P>
verbal charades was the evening activity.  Geal got up and said in
front of everyone, looking at me, Do you have any friends?  I want
to know.  Someone else followed and asked, I want to know if you
have any breasts. they laughed eee eee ee.
<P>
darts that would just graze me so that they could see my eyes
widen.  not darts that would hit me in the stomach, because it was
filled with blood and would burst like a water balloon if hit
directly, and they would be held responsible. but one dart that
would whiz close enough and make me fall off and splatter all over
the floor.  so I'd sit there with my bag of blood and try to
pretend the bunkbed was a treehouse and wish and wait and wish and
wait for someone to climb up.
<P>

     One time we got Lucky.  She was hitchhiking to the next city. 
Wane had just been grumping again, We should have gotten a smaller
car.  What a crazy idea, a van for just the two of us.  There's way
too much room.  Too bulky. 
     <P>
     When she got in the van it was hard to pinpoint exactly what
Wane was going to showcase this time, but it was bound to surface. 
Lucky was bubbly immediately and pointed to the snapshots we drove
by.  Like a bike in a tree.  Go Lucky.  Wane saying, Yeah I m a
photographer too.  When he finally looked over at me, it was in
revulsion for my hangdog reactions.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     Trace: Are you rucked? (Trace's word for stood up.)<BR>
     Wane: Not now I'm not.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I could see Trace and Wane and the conversations they were going to
have when Wane and I got back and then made up ones that I wished
they were going to have.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     Wane: Most people go by the nail in wood.  A love partner like
a nail so deeply wedged in wood can only be removed by driving in
another nail on top.<BR>
     Trace: But then love is a coffin, love is a coffin, love is a
coffin.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
     Wane's eyes watched me near pay phones, but I was good.  I
never called. I did once though before our trip and I never want to
let anyone make me feel bad for acting.  Not that kind of acting. 
But, for now, I never was going to mention his name until this trip
was over.
     <P>
     All I had was this one photograph, the fingerprints kept to
the edges only.  It is Trace's apartment.  Trace jammed the wobbly
extra square table into the corner.  But in one swoop this guy came
in and dragged it out like a dead body -- the noises on the floor
-- onto the balcony and wiped it down with the edge of his shirt. 
We go back in for chairs and Trace tells me that his name is Liner
and that she is leaving.  And then I remember chairs unfolding on
either side of the table like wings.  He saying holy shit.  Me
saying no fucking way.  The flopping table-top moving our hands
together.
<P>

     When I came back from hanging out by myself by the road again,
Wane and Lucky were dusting themselves off but I could feel they
were still thirsty.
     Lucky said, pointing my way, I can tell to keep you away from
the frying pan.  You're on your own laid-back time, girl.  You d
get everything burnt.  Wane going, Don't I know it.  Don't I know
it.  Then they were scurrying through the back of the van for some
kind of breakfast they could pour a lot of syrup on.
     My laid-back self tried to sleep to stay away.
<P>

I was sleeping from my top corner bunkbed like a night owl. they
were stirring their spaghetti-from-a-can in their unallowed hot
pots waiting for the boils.  if only I could stick my beak into
their foreheads and drag each noodle from their head to straighten
things out.  was it the money.  the mostly divorced and remarried
parents.  whatever it was, it was like leaving orange juice in the
sun.
<P>

     Whisky became our new mouthwash of choice. Bathrooms on the
road were grosser than we were.  So we avoided them, I am not going
to let him make me feel gross about this, my straggly heart sizzle
sticks.  Whisky, making the insides more parched all the time.  
     <P>
     Some mornings we made it to the washroom and that's where
Lucky finally confronted me.  I was swizzling water in a glass for
the third time waiting for her to leave.  I saw her staring at me
through the mirror, her fists on her hips, and I knew something was
coming.  She was waiting for me to ask what is it while I went for
the toothpaste, you know today I have this thing for clean teeth
and I'm making sure to brush every tooth five times.  I was half
expecting her to grab the tube and glob up my nose like those girls
at camp used to do in my sleep when they were just starting out
with candy tricks.  The old feeling had got the hairs on my body
standing up like nails again.
<P>
at the showers, those girls were feet side-stepping my floorboards
and I knew something more than steam was seeping out.  the guys
came up to me afterwards and told me I was a freak for having
orange pubic hair.  then they avoided taking the orange Freezies
for evening snack just to prove it.
<P>
     You really messed him up bad, Lucky was letting it out in
hammers.  She smeared on the walls, Don't you care?  And still
after all these years I kept polishing my mouth and didn't use it
to say anything.
<P>

and so, Wane, do you see me through negatives. are you chortling on
your false blackmail photos back at the campsite at this very
moment. are you like me here out beside the road again. when I go
back, will you accuse me again with something so preposterous. 
that you saw me and Lucky holding hands last night in the back of
the van. and even what if we were. is that so revolting to you.
maybe if I'll pick you some of these blackberries I can get through
to you by your stomach. that's the way it was supposed to be,
right.
<P>

     When you find dimes or paperclips or gems on the ground it's
called a `ground score' Trace told me once.  I was biting a nail
that came right off when I smashed upon Wane and Lucky writhing in
the campfire s ashes.
     <P>
     Wane was spewing past Lucky's ear, Hickey me hard and suck
some more so my bruises will show.<BR>
     Not even one drop of blood surfaced on my broken up finger.<BR>
     I panicked, crushing berries and maybe the blood will come.  
<P>

there is a place where courtship is really fucked up.  I was
sleeping the porch outside the cabin.  Geal was sitting on the side
trying to impress some guy, she was whispering into his ear.  the
next thing I know, she's grabbing the broom from me and stabbing me
in the crotch.  her lips drawn back like labia in example snarling:
I'm gonna stick this up your cunt.  I'm gonna stick it up your
cunt.
<P>
the guy in hysterics drinking it all in. and he like everyone else
at this feeding ground looking like he's straight out of a milk
commercial.
<P>

     I followed rocks out barefoot towards some sort of road.  Geal
was there.  An older her definitely but not one wrinkle.  She got
to see my face and hands stained, the black clots of berries
showing.
     She, grinning, telling me how she's going to Berkeley for
psychology in the fall.  Psychology of all things.  She spent all
of two minutes to rub that in and strategically ask, So where are
you going? before disappearing.  The rocks gathering in my knees.
<P>
I don't know how much longer I can do these spirals. and I don't
know if I can help you set us free, Wane. and I don't know if there
will be anything left of me.  I had set out with thoughts of
healing, I swear.
<P>
I think the last of me is drying up now.
<P>
I saw my ghost's view looking down on me from above and the only
blood I had left was the purple lining of my black leather jacket
strewn open.
<P>
then I was back in my jacket and Trace was there. the clouds,
sheer, curtains being cut, and Trace wading through them. when she
was close enough to me she crouched down dipping her fingers in the
purple like she was leaving the edges of a photograph.
Wane's not around, the sound out there, So, Who do you really love?
I tried to touch the wafting voice, yes, I really love. I really
love.
but it wasn't the old Trace and she just laughed, the ees curling
out in her Lucky Strikes smoke way, blackening the ethereal
curtains.
<P>
I tried to remember the photograph. Trace is wearing a summer dress
with spaghetti straps. she captures the sun with her emerald eyes.
she is not used to seeing me without Wane. she flip flops between
her three types of making coffee. between the kitchen and Liner and
I in the living room back and forth and then by some chance is out
of filters fuck and has to go out. 
<P>
even when Trace is not there her essence gives off a raw smell, but
all her edges are refined. she, carefully crafting the assortment
on the ledge by the window. she displaying the porcelain dishes
with swirls, catching eyes. she, leaving her way of saying things
in the apartment, the way she pronounces words like deluxe and
swank, it puffed up cushions. it's usually hard to stay awake
around her, even with my Salada eyes.
<P>
Liner's eyes have the square table in the corner on the balcony. 
Liner's eyes saying, Salada eyes rag up my tongue.  I take the rag
up to my lips. his eyes drive past them.
<P>
when Trace got back she looked at me like she'd been given the job
of stage sweeper and I put the broom in her hand. and I was still,
waiting for her to hand over a sunburst guitar and call me on.
<P>
     But what if I gave you the guitar, Wane?  Would that finally
do it?
     <P>
     Wane was scavenging through my body bag, taking items.  By
that time, I had cleaned myself off and he's packing, probably for
the last time, according to Wane's plan anyway.  Lucky had already
taken off with the six rolls of film.
     <P>
     That's my Young T-shirt, he was stammering.  I'm taking this
fuck-me tape.  I'm getting the deposits back for all the empties
too, so just forget about it.  
     <P>
     <I>He told me I'm giving but it's become a curse many
centuries ago</I>.  
     <P>
     I grabbed my journal before he got to it.  No fucking way.<BR>
     I just don't understand, he said.

<P>
although it was really obvious to everyone in that whole camp what
was going on, only once did someone address it. she got all the
leads in the play. she was the only one who liked Billy Idol. she
sat next to me once on the hot pavement of the tennis courts, where
everyone was called if there was an emergency. the asphalt burning
our asses. and there was a lot of waiting around. so she told me
this story. she told me of her mom's boyfriend and how he'd only
eat carotene pills on some weird health trip.  she'd always be
like, so have a potato chip, and he'd shrivel back from the exuding
grease. well, one day he turned up at breakfast with orange skin.
and that one's true.
<P>

     Finally the van was approaching the drive into the city and it
could only encroach so far.  Wane would keep looking up through the
windshield for the moon like a spotlight or something, but it
wasn't there.
     <P>
     Slowly our hands met like a spider finding another one out
there.  He murmured, I hope things work out for you.  I hope that
we're friends.
     <P>
     In the same dance he withdrew his hand and tossed me out of
the sticky humid van and rolled off. 
     <P>
     He's headed straight to Trace, I knew this when he slammed the
door shut.
     <P>
     Maybe he's going there to confirm that she's on his side. 
Maybe to head straight back to where we came from and it was all
for nothing.  Maybe to head to her just for some wind itself.
     <P>
     But they both withdrew into the night afterwards and I
couldn't touch them.
<P>

on the noon before Wane and I left on our trip, Trace rented a
black limousine and kept driving it past my window. she would never
give me the words why.
<I>
     I fled the windowed room and tried to flow down the steps
feeding clawed-torn pieces of white dress like blank pages to the
swirl above.
     <P>
     I fled the steps looking at my skin being slowly revealed in
the outdoor light and was terrified that it would be mutated into
some strange moldy colour from the green that had come in through
the window or into some crusted colour from the sun on the roof. 
But there it was, my skin for me to scratch only.
     <P>
     And each white dress piece leaving was a paper that didn't
have my blood.  A million reasons for them to use their own blood
and still they'll call me ungrateful to a million friends.
     <P>
     And as much as the dew felt cool on my savaged skin, I was
wading through grass hunched over, naked again.  The white pieces
leaving me.
</I>
<P>
     It had been two months and I didn't know if it was going to
happen.  I had to remind myself how to make a phone call.  I had to
wait praying for a lift in his voice.  I had to describe where I
was...  Somewhere grassy and writing everywhere.  It was too much. 
Liner showed and knelt to me lying there and had even brought tea.
<P>
<I>
Wane was at the top of the tower, his elbows grinding into the
stone bricks.  Those branches could be her finger veins.  That
silver river could be her spine.  But wherever she was, the dark
ink was bleeding over the sliver of the moon making it hard to read
things.  The tower went so high up that each black tear that fell
had the power of a driving nail by the time it hit the ground.  I'm
going to stay in the tower 'til she comes.  Oh when she comes, the
wind will blow the grass towards me and show her the way.  And to
the general direction of the grass he gasped, Where is my June?
