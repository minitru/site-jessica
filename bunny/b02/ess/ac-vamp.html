   Oral Defence: Self-definition In Anne Rice's<BR>
<I>Interview With the Vampire</I><BR>
Anthony N. Chandler

     <P>
     For humans, as Dr. Maggie Kilgour writes in <I>From
Communion to Cannibalism</I>, the self can be
constructed through sexuality, eating, drinking and
another oral activity that is similar to eating; verbal
communication. (Kilgour 8)
<P>
For the vampire, however, food and sex become one in
the drinking of the victim's blood.  As such, consuming
the blood of his or her victim perfects incorporation
and rejects the temporality of sexual union.  When
Rice's vampires couple with a victim, the result is a
consummation that becomes a consumption.  Of course, a
vampire with a conscience must ask why he must consume
another life to sustain himself.  He must ask if his
existence warrants the loss of another's life. 
Certainly the narrator of Anne Rice's <I>Interview With
the Vampire</I>, Louis,  has asked this of himself. 
Moreover, he has defined himself  through 
consummation/consumption, and now turns to the final
stage of self-definition; the verbal definition, the
justification of his existence to another in a
confessional interview.
<P>
     Rice plays with associations between eating and
sex.  For Rice's vampires, feeding becomes a metaphor
for sexual union, a type of oral sex.  Kilgour notes,
"Like eating, intercourse makes two bodies one, though
in a union that is fortunately less absolute and
permanent." (Kilgour 7) 
<P>
     In his film version of the novel, Neil Jordan
visually highlights sexual eroticism.  Two male
vampires, Lestat and Louis, seduce and devour an
unsuspecting tavern girl while watching the
carnivalesque scene that plays before them. (Interview
17:08-18:52).  This scene demonstrates how the
protagonist consumes the blood of his victim,
incorporating it into himself, as one might snack on
potato chips while watching  television.  Arguably, the
clip lacks authority because it differs from the novel. 
However, it works on a visual level, linking kissing to
consumption.
<P>
       As sensual intensity increases, the viewer
observes the blur between the desire for consummation
and the hunger for consumption.  Hence, the  point of
communion (where the victim and the victor both receive
pleasure from the encounter) now becomes cannibalism. 
In this scene Rice's character enacts Kilgour's
assertion that when the struggle is "between communion
and cannibalism, cannibalism has usually won." (Kilgour
7).
<P>
     If the metaphor of blood drinking as sexual union
holds true,  then this is a coming of age, a
deflowering of the "virgin" vampire's identity.  Lestat
becomes Louis' experienced lover leading him in the
act.  As Louis innocence is shed, he cries, "I will not
take her life" but it is too late.  From this point
Louis questions his actions, his needs, his desires,
and attempts to come to grips with his new identity: a
vampiric self struggling to displace the old human self
with all of its pre-established morals. 
<P>
     Kilgour in <I>From Communion to Cannabalism</I>
asserts that "as  you are what you eat,' eating is a
means of asserting and controlling individual and
cultural identity." (Kilgour 6)   As such, the narrator
attempts to control his individual identity by
controlling what he eats.  From the Bible to Rabelais
the idea of transforming blood into wine is present. 
Lestat mocks the transubstantiation ritual:
<P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE>"Rats can be quite nice", he said.  And
he took the rat to the wine glass, 
     slashed its throat, and filled the glass rapidly
with blood . . .  And then he 
     sipped the blood as delicately as if it were
burgundy.  He made a slight 
     face. <BR>
     "It gets cold so fast".<BR>
          "Do you mean that we can live from animals?"
I asked <BR>
                    (Rice 29)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
     After the epiphany, that he may survive on
something more morally acceptable to his past self, 
Louis becomes the selective eater/lover that St.
Augustine defines in <I>Confessions</I>:  "I struggle
daily against greed for food and drink.  This is not an
evil which I can decide once and for all to repudiate
and never to embrace again, as I was able to do with
fornication." (Kilgour 49)  This works rather well for
a medieval saint, but what happens to the modern
vampire, a creature whose food and drink is also his
fornication.  Blood is not an evil Louis can repudiate
without death, for as Louis mentions, "Blood, I was to
find, was a necessity itself." (<I>Interview</I>
17:08).  
<P>
     Rice's character defines his self through
metaphorical acts of a heterosexual, homosexual,
masturbatory and paedophiliac nature.  The vampire
turns to all of the aforementioned identification
tactics in an effort to come to terms with the self
within a never ending existence.  After all, an eternal
self must incorporate all sexual experiences and
preferences if it is to be complete in an unending
world.
<P>
     In the beginning, Louis adopts an Augustinian
approach to calming his hunger by drinking the blood of
rats, pigeons and other vermin.  However, the blood of
vermin cannot satisfy Louis' vampiric hunger.  On the
level of bodily nourishment it is similar to a failed
attempt at vegetarianism.  On the sexual level, Louis'
attempt to avoid consuming human blood is similar to
masturbation, desire calmed but never satiated.
<P>
     Failing to find identity as a frugal gourmet, Louis
takes Claudia, a very young girl, and feeds from her. 
Devastated and repulsed with his weakness, he flees. 
After Lestat makes Claudia a vampire, Louis attempts to
define the self by having a relationship with one of
his own kind.  But the effectiveness of this
relationship proves to be less than satisfying.  He
then has a homo-erotic encounter with Armand, the
Parisian vampire leader, where they share a young
servant boy in a slow, teasing drain.
<P>
     At the end of the novel, Louis loses his past
identity, becoming nothing more than the food he
incorporates.  He no longer defines the self on human
terms, but rather on a preternatural level.  His
surrender comes to a climax after achieving a
metaphorically heterosexual union with Madeleine, a
woman who Louis transforms into a vampire to be a
companion for Claudia.  Louis tells Claudia that "What
died tonight in this room  is the last vestige in me of
what was human." (Rice 245)  The vampire self has
assumed the host human body and now begins to define
itself. Louis'  metaphorical sexual experimentation has
ended and he must acknowledge that he is as he began: a
vampire who kills to survive.  He does this by
returning to visit his maker/first sharer, Lestat.
<P>
     The narrator articulates Louis' struggle in the
interview.  The first difficulty is to let go of his
human pain.  He must then begin the transition from
human to vampiric self.  Finally, Louis must define
that vampiric self.  In an act of communion with
Madeleine, Louis makes the final break.
<P>
     How does the individual create an image of the
self, knowing that his existence depends upon the
slaughter and incorporation of others?  Rice gives the
reader three possible models to connect morality with
the unchangeable needs of the body.  Lestat resigns
himself to becoming a ruthless hunter, searching for
nothing but the finest prey to take into his body, to
quicken his dead heart.  Armand represents the
Nietzschean apostle who attempts to define the morality
of self against the teachings of a god who,  he
eventually decides, does not exist.  Louis, a Thomas
Hardy- type character, wrestles with the preternatural
aspects of his existence.  Only after failing to find a
companion against which he can define himself does he
turn to the confessional.  He defines the self through
verbal communication; the interview.  
<P>
     Kilgour discusses "how attitudes towards
incorporation change depending on our relations to our
own bodies and self-definitions." (Kilgour 7)   Louis'
attitude towards incorporation begins to change changes
as he progresses from a human  to a vampiric self.  No
longer is he disgusted with drinking human blood, for
after two hundred years as a vampire, he is no longer
killing "his own kind." 
<P>
     Before displacement of the human self Louis was
disgusted with his need to incorporate what he believed
to be those of his own image.  Louis  mistakenly
believed that he was breaking  the undeniable law that
you do not "kill your own kind" let alone eat them.
(Rice 222)   However, as his relation to his bodily
hungers and new definition of self changes, so does his
attitude towards them.  Louis' final resort to verbal
definition is not surprising because, as Kilgour
indicates, "Another oral activity that is similar to
eating but offers a less physical model for exchange is
verbal communication, rooted in the body and yet
detached from it . .  Food is the matter that goes in
the mouth, words the more refined substance that
afterward comes out" (Kilgour 8)  The interview
represents the "more refined substance" that can be
accessed only after much of the world is incorporated
into Louis.
<P>
     Louis tell his child companion that "We need our
language, our people.  I want to go directly now to
Paris." (Rice 180)  Louis thereby begins to flirt with
the identification of the self with familiar language. 
He feels a need, albeit it human, to hear words known
to his ears.  He attempts to use words to express his
angst, to bring his struggle into accessible terms. 
This identification with a language and a people
perhaps serves as a prelude to the interview he later
wishes to conduct.  By instigating an interview with a
journalist, Louis not only commences a confession of
his sins, but also contemplates his eternal vampiric
self through the "vampire eyes" of the narrator. 
Louis's self-examination confirms the human need to
define the self in relation to others.  While the
narrator admits to having come to terms with the sins
of his immortal identity, it is only through placing
his internal thoughts upon an external form of media
that his notion of self becomes fully formed.  In
<I>Interview With the Vampire</I>, the need to justify
the actions of the self for purposes of identity
construction is answered by the blood-drinking narrator
through verbal communication; the interview.  It is not
something that Louis wants but rather, as he tells the
boy who interviews him, "Believe me, I won't hurt you. 
I want this opportunity.  It's more important to me
than you can realize now.  I want you to begin." (Rice
4)   At this point the reader is under the illusion
that the interviewer is in control, but from the boy's
first question, "How did it come about?", we see that
Louis has his own agenda for the interview.  He replies
that "There's a simple answer to that.  I don't believe
I want to give simple answers . . I think I want to
tell the real story . . ."  (Rice 4)  What is the "real story"?  
<P>
     Louis' interview is more than a simple confession. 
Louis intends to say, to quote T.S. Eliot, "'I am
Lazarus, come from the dead\ Come back to tell you all,
I shall tell you all"  (Eliot 94-5)  The interview is
Louis' method to justify his previous attempts to
define the self through his struggle with consumption
and consummation.  When Louis realizes that the
interview has broken down, that one has settled a
pillow by his head and said  "That is not what I meant
at all: that is not it at all" (Eliot 96), Louis' 
self-definition recedes. The communion ends.  Louis
attacks the interviewer and drinks his blood. (Rice
309-9).
<P>
     "You don't know what human life is like!",  the
interviewer screams at the end of the interview.  On
the edge tears he says, "You've forgotten. You don't
even understand the meaning of your own story." (Rice
308)  The interviewer is correct, Louis does not
understand his own story.  Despite Louis' attempts to
extricate a verbal definition of self, the interview
proves inadequate.  The finality of the action of
drinking the interviewers blood becomes the only true
definition of self.  This action is Louis' oral
defence, a fanged reply defining the reality of what he
has become: a modern vampire, an eternal being who
kills what he once was in order to survive.
